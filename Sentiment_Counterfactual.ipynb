Still , the potential for the series seemed so that I went ahead and read this one too , only to be even less with the franchise . This is a sequel , and any newcomers are advised to read the misadventures of Thursday Next is order , one miss out of allusions to events . Although ... on consideration , maybe it does n't matter , since clearly anything can and will happen in this series , and Fforde is n't all that in keeping to a plotline anyway . The setting is the as the book , an mid-1980s England in which literature is the preoccupation . Fresh off the events of `` The Eyre Affair '' , Thursday Next ( a police officer specializing in literature related crimes , as first-edition forgeries , manuscript thefts , and the ) is gritting her teeth through a round of fame as the woman who saved Jane Eyre ( and changed the ending for the ) , when all she wants to do is cuddle up at home with her husband Landen . Unfortunately , the Goliath Corporation has managed to use a member of the Chronogaurd ( police ) to delete Landen from this timeline and are holding his existence hostage . In the book Thursday imprisoned one of their men inside Poe 's `` The Raven '' , and it seems they want him back . This a potentially plot , but it keeps get lost amidst all the things Fforde throws into the mix . are a series of coincidences which keep coming close to killing Thursday ( and are also linked to events in the book ) . Another plotline concerns the discovery of a `` lost '' Shakespeare play , which looks to be the most event of the century , if Thursday can authenticate it . There 's also the matter of Thursday 's pregnancy . And just when one is with Thursday 's role as a `` SpecOps Litratech '' , and that milieu , she 's thrown into an entirely one as a member of `` Jurisfiction '' , a kind of police comprised of book characters who move around in works and maintain order ... Finally , her father pops up to inform her that something in the timestream has gone and the world is going to be turned into a mass of pink sludge in a days unless he can figure it out , and can she help him . Phew ! I 've probably missed one or two elements , but you get the idea . Fforde is just brimming with ideas , but the shame of it is that he ca n't stop and give any of them the attention they deserve . It 's to get invested in any of the plotlines when you know he 's just going to move on to something else in a pages , and it 's to care about the characters when their existence is , as is time and place . I suppose it 's all meant to be fun , but the effect is more an attention deficit disorder Nancy Drew meets a poor-man 's Douglas Adams .

Said directs and manipulates the taste for self criticim , and all that does is deflect the world 's attention from Arab and Moslem attrocities committed against Christians , Kurds , Jews , Israelis , Coptic Christians , Sudanese , etc . Thus , reading Said , you would never realize that Sadam Hussein 's poisoning of the Kurds has never been condemned by one Arab or leader . This is because a racist attitude in the mind is that the Middle East should be Arab . This also explains the attitude towards Israel , a country that is predominantly and speaks a Middle Eastern language than Arabic . The pity is that Said himself is a , yet he never spoke on behalf of Christians in Egypt , or the right of Christians to practice their faith in Saudi Arabia and probably places in the World .

The Paleo Diet is based on an premise- the idea that what we ate before agriculture suited our needs perfectly because our bodies had been bred by evolution in response to our what we could find to eat in our environment . It seems like a leap to assume our ancestors naturally gravitated towards exactly what we need to eat . Animals in the do make choices of the time , because their decisions are . creates a problem that does n't exist for behavior as it does for humans . Sometimes we do things out of curiosity , or laziness , or beliefs . So , considering the behavior of humans , who is to say our ancestors were any more about their needs ? Even the book suggests humans ate what they did out of trial and error , frequently just trying whatever they encountered in the wild . The fact that foods are frequently in nutrients than foods does not mean that you must subscribe to a diet to take advantage of this fact . Rather , eat food . Just about anything from the wild will be a food , unless the environment from which it comes is and that is a very problem . Meat is a very thing nowadays , not like it was in the pristine wilderness of the era . The Paleo diet would be a thing if we were still in that world . Now , we need to worry about metals in flesh , and antibiotics and growth hormones in feedlot animals . Beef will have some naturally 3 if the animals were allowed to wander in a more or less fashion , as they did when the most employed mechanism for animal control was the cowboy . This is no longer . The cut of meat in your supermarket is taken from a feedlot animal , fed the food and in conditions in the extreme . Basing a diet on meat in this day and age can be . You must choose your meat sources carefully . Meat made from animals raised on pesticide-free in a caring manner can be very to find . I found Loren 's rejection of all products of development a little too minded , and in some cases . There is nothing at all about grain foods or legumes consumed in moderation , and loss could occur for people if they ingested grains and legumes but conscientiously avoided only the products of agriculture : fructose corn syrup , acids , sweeteners , foods raised non-organically with pesticides and herbicides , and improperly raised food animals . My objection to the book is nearly one hundred pages ( about half ) of the book is dedicated to the convincing you this thing is and and your time . I think the forward to the book or perhaps the chapter alone would have been for that purpose . After a while you get the feeling Loren is trying too to sell this idea to you , and it really interferes with the flow of the book . Further , a lot ( but not all ) of the studies cited show only advantages of aspects of this diet . The claims that you will experience loss and feel than you ever have are to imagine , and peppered throughout the book . But it 's to believe with the than overwhelming studies cited . One nitpick . One way to compensate for the lack of food taste enhancers like salt and sugar is the use of herbs and spices . something very much like the paleo already exists as part of cuisines around the world . It 's a pity the recipes included do not explore those , but instead offer somewhat watered down and fare instead . Espscially cuisines frequently make with alot of the ingredients that are on the paleo diet , and their spices make it all the more . I found the recipes far too and .\", \"Biased , , and misleading If you want a and account of the Arab war against Israel , this ought to satisfy you . Shlaim tells us that Jabotinsky , in discussing Zionism explained that `` if the cause is just , justice must triumph . '' I think Jabotinsky made a very point here . You see , beings will , if given the chance , tend to buy land in the places they wish to live in . The ones who can make use of the land and wish to do so will be the bidders for the land . If consists of stealing that land from them and justice consists of letting them buy the land and keep it ( which they will wish to do if they are offered only prices for it ) , then it is to see what the triumph of justice would mean here . In , it would mean a Israel and a triumph for Zionism . Shlaim appears to have missed all this . To him , Zionism is . And to him , the triumph of terror and theft is both and . He tells us that a Levantine Arab state `` is . '' I disagree . It may be . But it would serve no purpose . It would not help Jews , Arabs , or others . Its purpose would be to damage Israel . The people of a state do not as yet have an language , religion , culture , cuisine , or policy . So I think there is still hope that sanity may prevail here . Shlaim also tells us that this Arab state will be `` , demilitarized , and territorially divided . '' Is it just that this , if , provides even reasons why neither side might want to create it at all ? And could that make the appearance of this state even less ? Or at less ? And the author also explains that both sides in the conflict will have to make `` compromises , '' and that Jerusalem will have to be `` the subject of bargaining . '' Really ? Is having peace and prosperity with borders a compromise ? For either side ? Of course not . Shlaim is kidding us if he expects us to believe that war , poverty , and destruction are somehow less . Had Shlaim been writing about France and Germany , we 'd have seen at once that the viewpoint is . He 'd have been telling us that the National Socialists needed an state in France , either to replace all of France or part of it . He would have laughingly dismissed claims on the basis of the idea of France being ! He 'd have sternly explained that a National Socialist state in France was both and .

ART\", \"I 'll Pass On Carb-Loading One Hour A Day When you have lost weight , it 's a very thing for others to be about how you lost your weight and kept it off . Whenever they have heard me tell my story , read my blog or book , or found out that I did it on the lifestyle , one question invariably has come up from time to time : '' What do you think about this diet where you can eat whatever you want for per day ? '' My reaction to these people was usually something along the lines of this : '' That 's absolutely ! There 's no way you could ever lose weight and keep it off using this method . '' I did the Atkins and honestly have not stayed on top of all the bazillion diets out there . But there was something very about this plan that it made me look around to find out about it . did I know there was an book out there about this very so people had been telling me about . It 's called The Carbohydrate Addict 's Diet and it was written by a husband/wife team Drs . Richard and Rachael Heller . The CAD diet , as it is referred to , makes the claim ( and I agree with it ) that people are addicted to carbohydrates and need to be weaned off from depending on them for sustenance . Just like a drug addict gets doses of their drug daily so they can eventually get by with and less , that concept is what goes into the CAD diet . If people think the Atkins is , then check out what you have to do on the CAD diet : BREAKFAST : meal consisting of protein and fat . LUNCH : meal consisting of protein and fat . You are allowed to eat any bread , fruit , milk , juice , and vegetables . Absolutely NO snacking whatsoever except for coffee or soda . You can not use sweeteners either . Sound appealing , anyone ? Hmmm ? I suppose if that 's all there was to this diet , then NOBODY would do it . But there is one aspect of the CAD diet that you probably will be in . DINNER : Eat amounts of protein , vegetables and dessert of whatever you want to eat in whatever amount , but it must be eaten in a time frame . You can even enjoy a beer or glass of wine with your `` reward '' meal . How 's that for incentive ? You basically starve all day long just so you can get to those minutes at the end of your day where you can say hello to the buffet line ! Who would n't enjoy a diet that lets you do THAT ? ! Well , I 'm still very about any change that encourages you to eat the very foods that got you overweight or to begin with on a basis . I caught a lot of flack from my low-carbers about my `` planned splurge '' meal every weeks during my loss . However , the Hellers give you a DAILY planned splurge ! ! ! What 's up with that ? We can blame this on Dr. Rachael , who stumbled upon this way of eating when she weighed 268 pounds after being on diet after diet . She became a psychologist to learn about why people overeat ( ostensibly to help herself in the process , too ) . She had skipped breakfast and lunch on a day she was fasting for a blood test and then , like of us would , ate to her heart 's content whatever she wanted for supper . The morning she noticed she had dropped 2 pounds . Thinking something must have gone with her scale , she tried it again the day , skipping breakfast and lunch and then eating a dinner and once again , she lost another pound . She played around with what would eventually become The Carbohydrate Addict 's Diet and went on to lose 150 pounds which she has kept off to this day . The frequency of eating carbohydrates is the key behind the CAD diet . The Hellers believe that anyone who consumes ANY amount of carbohydrates during the day will set off all the bells and whistles in your body that you are faster than if you avoided them altogether . They say that eating carbs throughout the day is like giving lots of doses of cocaine to a cocaine addict . It will make them crave their poison even more ! That 's why you basically avoid eating carbs on the CAD diet until the end of the day . This process of getting over addiction is a one , and the Hellers think they have found a plan for making it work for lasting loss in people . I still ca n't get around the fact that you do n't change the habits of the people who have packed on the pounds . , they basically starve themselves throughout the day before they eat their one BIG meal each day , but how is that stimulating the metabolism and preventing the obstacle to weight loss success -- HUNGER ! There 's no way I could do the CAD diet because I enjoy eating every 2-3 hours to keep my process constantly in motion . I truly believe this is one of the things that has helped me lose the weight and keep it off . Since you can not snack or use sweeteners on the CAD diet , it would literally drive me insane even if there was that `` reward '' meal at the end of the day ! Wan na take a test to see if you are a addict ? Click here to take the Carbohydrate Addict 's Test . I scored a 2 , which means `` You do not appear to be addicted . '' No kidding , ya think ?

'' The events recounted in `` Rise to Rebellion '' involving the lead up to the Revolutionary War seemed so much and , with a array of characters that were so ; John Adams , Paul Revere , Samuel Adams , Ben Franklin , and others . `` The Glorious Cause '' was not without its merits , but it seemed so and less appealing , with a more focus .

I kept hearing all these things about FREAKONOMICS , a book by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner , so when I ran across it at 25 % off , I did a freakin ' thing and bought it . I thought , What the freak , I 've got a pretty mind and I 'm to seeing things differently , to discovering viewpoints . The doubt started early when I got the book home and I first noticed the glowing comments on the dust jacket from the likes of Time , The New York Times , The Washington Post , and The Los Angeles Times . When all of the news agencies are lining up to tell me how a publication is , I 'm immediately going to be ' . Author Malcolm Gladwell tells us on the cover , `` Prepare to be dazzled . '' Well , evidently Ol ' Malcolm is dazzled a lot than I am . ( I wo n't even mention the smug mug of Stephen Dubner that taunted me from the book 's dust jacket because I do n't want you to get the idea that I judge a book by its cover . Or in this case , a writer by his physiognomy . So I wo n't mention that . ) If you 're the kind of person who is amazed to learn that 70 % of auto accidents occur within 10 miles of a driver 's home , then you just MIGHT be dazzled by FREAKONOMICS . If I tell you that the company that issues its employees only 3 shirts , thinking that it is cutting costs , is probably increasing its overhead , and this fact astounds you - if you must ask `` But how ? '' - then yes , buy FREAKONOMICS and be dazzled . Mostly what FREAKONOMICS offers ( when its conclusions can be trusted ) is just what we used to call `` sense . '' But since America has been reduced to a bunch of corpulent , zombies staring vacuously at that box of SURVIVORS , and AMERICAN IDOLS , and LOST knuckleheads , sense now appears to dazzle the ( when you can sever them from that box and put a book in their hands , that is ) . I dove into FREAKONOMICS hoping to find my purchase worthwhile . I got no than page 13 when my fears were realized : everything would require and verifying . On that page , Smug Mug tells us ( based on a report by the Institute Of Medicine ) that `` drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health . '' Fortunately , I read YOUR BODY 'S CRIES FOR WATER by Doctor F. Batmanghelidj over a decade ago so I already knew what a bunch of bunk that was . In chapter 4 , Smug Mug `` proves '' that legalizing abortion in 1973 with the Roe v. Wade decision was for a drop in the crime rate . This represents the centerpiece of his book , both literally and ideologically . The thing the reader must accept is that there really has been a drop in crime since the 1990s . On page 92 , the author acknowledges that the police in Atlanta were discovered to be crime in the ` 90s in hopes of landing the 1996 Olympics . Well , would police forces nationally have an incentive to underreport crime generally if it has actually dramatically increased since the ` 90s as predicted ? True , being might be means to an increased budget , but it sure would make your department appear inept and to maintain control . And surely the Chamber Of Commerce and the business interests would frown on that perception . Let me ask , do YOU actually feel you 're less to be the victim of a crime now than you did in the 1990s ? That 's , me neither . There 's so crime now that some of what was once reported to the police agencies goes , and recently , an officer friend told me that cops can no longer engage in some of the micro-policing they were to do in the ` 80s and ` 90s because crime is so now . In dismissing factors for the drop in crime ( if this claim is a verity ) , Dubner states that increased police personnel accounts for only 10 % of the drop . Having a bit into the nature of police work than does the , it 's that I find myself even contending with the stats Smug Mug uses that actually WORK AGAINST his theory : I believe the hiring of police officers since the ` 90s could have impacted the crime rate only minimally - than the 10 % - while actually increasing the coffers via traffic citations significantly . And Dubner concludes that firearm laws `` simply do n't bring down crime . '' ( Be sure to read the fascinating book , GUNFIGHTERS , HIGHWAYMEN VIGILANTES by Roger D. McGrath , for a decidedly and viewpoint ! ) In dismissing all explanations for the drop in crime except abortion , I did n't notice any mention of the increase in homeschooling and the proliferation of schools since the ` 90s , and I wonder if that might have some bearing . Ya think ? Yes , I think Smug Mug is . He calls some abortions a `` crude and sort of insurance policy . '' Not `` . '' Not `` . '' But then I did n't expect Smug Mug to call a sin a sin . And even if Levitt and Dubner 's hypothesis is , that abortions have lowered crime , the fact remains that not every child would have eventually murdered an person , but every child was an person murdered . So why are we even discussing this ? I 'll tell you why : because the folks can feel a slightly shifting consensus , and now they 're pulling out all the stops , trying to `` statistically '' convince the masses that they 're safer with all those criminals missing . I find this repulsive ! ( And there are studies indicating that those missing people have , and will continue to have , a impact on society . ) I wo n't even go into chapter 5 , What Makes A Parent ? Suffice to say that as ( surprise ! surprise ! ) all the statistics Dubner employs nearly always seem to confirm the rightness of the dogma on each issue . Funny how those numbers always crunch beliefs . Just know that if you 're a working mother , you have n't cheated your child in the , but if you 're a dad who thinks that an spanking is in order , you are `` . '' If your kid is watching lots of TV , it is n't turning the `` child 's brain to mush . '' ( No word on whether or not it 's turning his/her morals to mush though . ) And the studies ( that we are called to pay attention to ) show `` that a child 's character was n't much whether or not he was sent to day care , whether he had one parent or two , whether his mother worked or did n't , whether he had two mommies or two daddies or one of each . '' ( I 've often wondered what might have happened to me if my Mom , who was home of the time , had n't been there to hammer the dangers of drugs into my head day after day , year after year , while I was growing up in the ` 60s and ` 70s . ) I 've given FREAKONOMICS two stars because I did find the section on the naming of children very , as well as the story of Stetson Kennedy 's fight against the `` three Ks . '' But if you 're than I am , you 'll borrow this book from your library rather than paying money for it . Economically speaking , that 's just `` cents . ''\", \"This book is Bedlam !

I hated it for the reason that it represents all that is about MFA program writing in the 30 years . The emphasis is entirely on STYLE . Forget story . Forget that your reader needs some reason to be reading the . Just throw out and string together language and the reader will follow you anywhere . Some of this thinking goes back to Henry James , some of it goes back to Virginia Woolf who was so of books with plots or dominating conceits ( like H.G . Wells ' THE TIME MACHINE ) . The 100 pages of this novel are about a estate deal and the people to whom Frank Bascombe is trying to sell a property . It 's brilliantly written . In fact , it 's so brilliantly written that I had a lot of problems seeing a sportswriter being so and articulate about his life , his loves , and the region of the country he inhabits . This book has no driving plot . In fact , it 's an arbitrarily chosen conceit : what happens on July 4th in the life of one guy .

And none of it is related to a plot or story or any reason whatever why a person -- any perso -- should pick up the book . Indeed , that seems to be the crux . I read this book because it was by Richard Ford , a man whom all of my colleagues in the mainstream fiction world revere . You must read this book , they said . So I did .

This book is supposed to be one of the novels of the 25 years . But will it be so in another 25 years ? Are novels now only to be monologues ( which Virginia Woolf preferred and said so in her essay `` Fiction '' ) ? Perhaps our values are changing . Perhaps the MFA programs in this country are in cultivating style rather than story . But what it eventually evolves into is a form of narcissism , wherein the author writes at length , putting on the page all of his or her thoughts about whatever and we 're supposed to . . . what ?

So my surprise when , after receiving this book from a friend of mine for Christmas , I read the account of the Children 's Crusade of 1212 . I had done research on this topic , so I was horrified to read the completely account of what occurred . Had the author not read any analysis on the subject from the 50 years ? If he had , he would have realized that there were actually two crusades - one consisting of mainly people led by Stephen of Cloyes who , when told to turn back by King Philip II , did so . That ended that crusade . The one , led by a shepherd from Germany named Nicholas , led a group across the Alps into Italy . Some left for home while others continued on to Rome . It 's to note that in Rome , received dispensations from their crusading vows because these `` children '' were either too or because they were . Perhaps until relatively recently , people believed in the Children 's Crusade because it represented a morality play or because some historians gave too credit to chronicles ( like Chronica Albrici monachi Trium Fontium ) which were written long after the crusade supposedly occurred , rather than relying on sources . Nor did they realize that the latin word `` pueri '' used in the chronicles can have meanings ( as men rather than children ) . In the analysis , you just ca n't rely on books like these to really teach you history . The you can do is read what they tell you and then try to verify it . If only the author had bothered to check the History Channel 's account of the Children 's Crusade on their website , or perhaps read the paper done by Peter Raedts in the Journal of Medieval History , or even just checked out the brief but entry online in wikipedia .

As , it is n't even a trashy novel ; instead of sex scenes , we get sermonizing . than that , what the authors have done is to turn the imagery of the Bible into a book , ignoring its messages in favor of promoting a preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it 's too . The book aspect can not be overemphasized . Even if you suspend enough to accept the rapture scenario ( an idea with virtually no support ) , in the characters ' actions , thought processes or rings . One gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a school student . God ends up looking like the villain , demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side Or Else . Whatever happened to the inspiring writers of yesteryear ? Who is the equivalent of C. S. Lewis , or Catherine Marshall , and why are n't they getting attention ? These were writers who actually made you THINK . LaHaye and Jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the thing God wants us to be doing ; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or thought . They show no interest in answering the sort of questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask . One wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all , or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter . These days , it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of Ann Coulter or Pat Robertson , whose mission seems to be to turn Christianity into a , caricature of what it once was . Perhaps all the thinkers really have been raptured .

Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns , germs and steel .

But when I read this collection some twenty-odd years ago , it nearly turned me off to the man altogether . The fiction is pretty ( although even that is n't Heinlein 's ) . But to describe the nonfiction accurately , I 'd have to use words that Amazon will remove from the review anyway . For the part , the pieces collected here represent a side of Heinlein I strongly dislike . Though I respect Troopers_ , it 's never going to be my Heinlein novel no matter how times we quibble over the definition of `` fascism '' -- and I 'm not going to have respect for the nonfiction in this collection . And mind you , it 's not because I disagree with Heinlein 's opinions ; it 's because he gave arguments for them and called people names when they differed . Some of the stuff collected here is to the point of being . ( At in his fiction , he was to create characters with points of view that differed from his and get into their heads well enough to present them sympathetically -- in , to grok them . Not here , boy . ) Heinlein ( who bought into the Korzybski/General Semantics fad pretty early on ) spent a lot of years dismissing philosophers as tailchasers who derive their premises from their conclusions . But his attempt at philosophy , as represented here in e.g . `` The Pragmatics of Patriotism '' , is very nearly the writing on philosophy I 've ever seen . Then , too , people who knew Heinlein report that despite his gentlemanly demeanor , he could be pretty toward people who disagreed with him . Well , he 's certainly here ; anybody who does n't agree with him on the need for buildup is dismissed as a poltroon or a . Even in the event that I thought he were _right_ , I would n't find this a very approach . Perhaps more surprisingly , his writings on _science_ are n't very . Asimov 's reputation as the `` explainer '' is in no danger here . This volume is only to _Grumbles from the Grave_ in cementing Heinlein 's reputation as a rather fellow whose characters were generally company than he was . When I want company , I 'll stick to D.B . Davis , Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis , and ( maybe ) Lazarus Long . And when I want to read some humane nonfiction by an SF master , I 'll still turn to Asimov . I credit Heinlein with three novels , ones , and a number of stories .

In his book , The Four Agreements , Don Miguel Ruiz , embodies four principles for experiencing freedom in life . He says that we should be with our words , not to take anything personally , do n't make assumptions , and to always do our . The basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents . He calls this process `` domestication '' ( p. 6 ) . Ruiz says that 95 % of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection . The agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the bonds that get in the way of our energy and to transform our lives . While there are nuggets of truth throughout the book , some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what I would consider to be to be an conclusion . In some instances he uses scripture to support his claims ; however , in looking further , he takes some of the passages from the Bible out of context . Some of his ideas are presented as if they were ideas , but I would think of us by a age , should already an understanding of these principles . Although his book has been highly rated , I hold the position that Mr. Ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer , therefore , losing standing with me as a reader . According to Ruiz , as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our beliefs . When we go against the rules we are punished ( or rewarded for compliance ) . The fear of rejection leads us to agree with , or become something that we are not . In essence , we become a carbon copy of someone else , as our parents . He says our tendencies are lost and we judge people based upon these agreements . He boldly states , lacking data to back it up , that 95 % of our beliefs are based upon a lie ( 13 ) . The implication is that we are merely nothing than a society of mindless , `` domesticated '' individuals , hurting ourselves , judging and victimizing people along the way . This kind of thinking negates the teachings associated with parenthood and the aspects they bring to our lives . By his interpretation , if 95 % of what we believe is a lie , then 95 % of what our parents taught us is also a lie . I would disagree . There are people who exist today as , members of society who I 'm would point out they too became a copy of someone else 's beliefs and values . If these role models are only filling our heads with lies and teaching us how not to be ourselves , by his interpretation , we do n't need parents , teachers , or leaders . He undermines our paradigms and omits that as adults we do have the ability to choose a path , which I believe is our right of passage . By his rational we lose the ability to choose our destiny . Instead , we become victims of it . One of the things we agree upon is his agreement , be with your word ; however , he misquotes the ( John 1:1 ) when he says `` In the beginning was the word and the word was with God , and the word was God . '' He uses it to epitomize the use of `` word '' as in what one speaks ( 26 ) . Looking a down in that passage , it also says `` The word was made and dwelt among us '' . This passage is not talking about a form of speech , or speaking , but rather `` Jesus Christ '' . Christ became and dwelt among us . In that chapter he says that `` sin begins with rejection of yourself '' ( 31 ) . However , in Christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law ( 1 John 3:4 ) and that sin is neglecting to do God 's will ( James 4:7 ) . It 's not about self , but about disobeying God 's ordinances . While I agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for , this is not a concept . children have learned by the age of 6 that if you do n't have something to say , do n't say it at all . In his agreement , do n't take anything personally ; he says that nothing people do is because of you . While this is to some degree , he leads the reader down a path of extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head , it was nothing . So in essence , when Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot by Amy Fisher , her expression of displeasure regarding Amy 's behavior was nothing than a form of projection because according to Ruiz `` you are dealing with yourself , not me '' ( 51 ) . No , realistically , Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot because Amy Fisher wanted her . This kind of encourages victims to remain in relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims . As an , I 'm that someone took 9/11 personally . According to Mr. Ruiz he takes neither nor criticism . It seems to place myself so far above reproach , that I would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism . When my College writing professor , gave me his opinion regarding my work , if I were following the authors line of reasoning , I would believe that my professor was `` trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his garbage '' as Mr. Ruiz suggests ( 49 ) . I would rather believe that my instructor has my interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a writer . Another agreement is about not making assumptions in life . He says when we make assumptions , in essence , we create drama . Unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely . Assumption is a part of a thought and reason ; even within the community a hypothesis ( or assumption ) is formed in order to test a theory . In order come to school each day I must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree , and that he or she must be enough in life to make it to work everyday . In his forth agreement , always do your , he claims it is based upon the actions of the three agreements , stating they will only work if you do your . Again , these are principles that almost any child has learned . While Ruiz does indeed some ideas , his concepts begin to unravel when he does n't back up his statements with facts , but instead takes a concept and follows an line of reasoning to reach his conclusion . I ca n't completely discount everything that he says , but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and rationalizations .\", \"Even 3 paragraphs show the inaccuracy Hart disputes O'Reilly 's claim that the US `` gives far and away more tax money for coutries than anyone else ... ..

It 's the stuff of Summer thrillers to be taken to the beach . But 319 pages later , the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the book in the jacket . Almost immediately , you 'll notice that Smith 's writing is as as the jungles that make the setting . However , despite the stream of words , his descriptions are often .

There are only really two couples to keep track of , and yet it 's for the third of the book to distinguish them . There is to keep you in what they 're doing or why they might be doing it . Smith 's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts .

What turned me off about this book was the structure and the writing style . The half of the book was essentially the author relating circumstances that were the product of Serendipity . He was simply in the place at the time , had virutally no idea how he got there , felt out of place the time ( even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London ) , and so now he thought he 'd wwrite a book about it . I also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at Salomon Brothers . He was there , he made a lot of money , for him - get over it ! I was also pretty because the matter has A LOT more . I might have actually enjoyed it - had I not read Den of Theives 7 years earlier , and already had some idea of how things took place .

When that is your rule of thumb , you 'll write a moving piece of literature , even if you 're not completely . Sparks is the master of telling without showing . I 'm honestly baffled by all the reviews it gets . The story is somewhat , but with no payoff . But the work is filled with passages like ( and these are from memory ; if I picked up the book to look for examples I 'd have to type the thing ) , `` He went to the refrigerator , opened the door , and took a beer . After opening it , he sat down on the deck . '' Or , `` Though she was overweight , she moved quickly around the table .

How could anyone write anything so', \"Definitely not Alcott 's `` Women '' I started reading this book expecting to like it - it 's , related to Little Women , won the Pulitzer , does n't feel like fluff , etc . However I had a really time getting into the book . For one , the language sounded much more than historically . I 've read works from the time period she 's supposed to be writing in , and rather than feeling in keeping with that era , this book felt of someone who makes use of her thesaurus . Also , I have n't read her book so did n't enter this novel with a trust for the author . Consequentally , I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women , I became . She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work . In some of her character choices , as one of the encounters between March and Marmee ( I 'm not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene ) , I believe that she made a departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters , and that Brooks really did not stay to the . The half of the book is also really . This could just be my taste , but the half moved so slowly ! The book started to pick up about half way through . Overall , the story being told and the Civil War aspects were n't , and could be a story in their right if she 'd just speed things along at the beginning . However , I think Brooks did the book a disservice by linking it to Little Women . I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book , because she was really changing their characters ( than Aunt March ) . The choices that Brooks ' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott 's book . In the afterward , Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women , even commenting how the March Family in Alcott 's book is n't very , and how `` Nobody in life is a goody-goody as that Marmee . '' If she felt that way , then why use them as the basis for her book ? Seen in that context , her liberties with Marmee 's character seem to just be a way to `` stick it '' to Alcott : `` ha ha , look how much more Marmee is now !\", \"Not for people While I found the writing style and the information interesting , the diet was , too and lacking fun basics that make diets .

I had studied one book on the subject by the author , but knowing that photography in the US is much more and I was striving to get a book by a photographer . I was disappointed by the book `` Composition '' by Tom Grill for a number of reasons : 1 . It does not cover all elements , and those that it covers are not explained in detail . It does not explain : - how elements with the shapes , sizes or tone interact with each , - the reverse perspective effect and its uses , - why and left sides of the photograph differ and why , how it can be used on practice , - how to balance `` '' of elements of the photograph , it touches it briefly and furthermore provides an example , - difference between center and the center of interest , how to balance them if they are in parts of the photo ( does not match each ) - all signs of perspective , it does not say anywhere that overlapping of objects is a sign of perspective ( as it may sound , it still should be marked in any work , especially when the author covers three elements ) - and much much more . 2 . It does not use photographs of the masters to illustrate the topic , neither does it show how composition works in art , which I believe is very . 3 . examples are in color , while ideas on composition are best explained using B W photographs . 4 . but not , composition is about meaning , making a message , not just how to balance elements within a frame . The book makes this statement , but in my opinion fails to provide examples , while you can fully appreciate the power of composition only by studying photos with explanation why precisely this photo is . : I believe that if you want to study composition you want to know all considerations , not just a and briefly explained `` '' . This books fails to provide approach to composition and at times can be misleading . I 'd be very if you could recommend me ( and folks that look at our reviews ) a more book on composition , I 'm there must be a book in on that subject . Thanks ! P.S . For those who can read in I advise a book by A. Lapin `` Fotografiya kak..

I agree with some of the reviewers that there is way too emphasis on the workings of the meetings . I feel like I 'm watching a video of it , as every thing is described in detail . But I wanted to read this book to understand the views and conclusions of the group , not to become an expert on the tea breaks they had .

There is no protoganist and not one character worthy of admiration -- and after a while , their actions just become . The author 's soul must truly be an ugly one to have devoted so time and energy to using his mind to generate so acts of evil throughout the book . It starts out promising but by the time you get to about halfway through the book or so you get a sense that your very soul might be sucked out of you and permanently stolen by the heart of Neil Gaiman 's darkness or one of his minions . Additionally , the characters ' motivations change like the shifting sands , nothing they do makes any sense except some movement towards doing and en masse like some sort of coagulating bacteria or disease . What is so about this book is the casualness of it all . Unlike some of Stephen King 's work ( : The Stand ) , there is absolutely no redeeming thread here -- no rallying or marshalling the troops to combat the emerging evil . It 's in vs. evil surrounded by evil . All I can say is that this book is ugly , ugly , ugly . At writers like Joyce Carol Oats and Joseph Conrad 's intentions when writing about things is to effectively demonstrate the effects of darkness , but to make heroes of characters one should avoid is . The choices the protoganist makes make no sense -- and you do root for him in the very beginning but you find he is just like one of them after all . I suspended my doubt and disbelief as long as I could but finally became so incensed by the audacity of both the critics and the author to pass this off as excellence , I literally stopped mid-sentence and chose to never read this author 's work again . It 's a shame too because he has allied himself in incarnations with a truly artist , Dave McKean , who maybe has n't completely gone over to the side like Neil has . His association with Dave McKean is the reason I even opened-up the book -- and maybe a because the title intrigued me . But it 's that the industry rewards `` '' works as Mr. Gaiman 's with praise . I 've never so strongly disliked a book . Have you ever found yourself getting because you felt robbed or duped by a book ?

There are sentences , paragraphs , even pages of brilliance in this book , but it is as if winning the National Book Award gave Ms. Glass confidence in her writing , and character development in . She seemed out of touch with the demographics the slings around . As another reviewer wrote , the writing process seemed . Reading the book , you get the feeling that the characters are what Ms. Glass ( a privileged woman of a age ) imagines teenagers , or New Mexicans , or chauffeurs , or nannies , or even people to be like . She is like a tourist who voyeuristically delights in cultures without really understanding them . The teenagers and the Santa Fe inhabitants are the most examples of caricatures . Greenie might be the most , and although I understood why she was falling out of love with her Alan , I was n't sucked along with her when she falls in love with `` the Charlie '' . He was only very mildly and certainly not ( even temporarily ) losing your child over . With Saga , she manages to develop her most character , but Saga 's life is left floating and unresolved at the end . Even the appearance of Fenno , who I loved in Three Junes , lacked intensity and seemed . All and all , a very novel .

Well , if so , I can tell you that a lot of people have been , or are going to be , VERY disappointed . Comparing the Super/System from 1978 with this book is , to paraphrase Mark Twain , like comparing lightning to the lightning bug . This book is of a tribute to Doyle Brunson than it is `` A Course in Power Poker . '' Johnny Chan writes a fairly Preface in which he lauds Brunson , but does n't say anything about how to play . Then we have Brunson 's Introduction in which he tells us mostly about the contributors to the Super/System . Next there is an sketch by Brunson entitled , `` My Story . '' ( If you want a book that gives the flavor of Brunson 's `` story , '' get a copy of According to Doyle ( 1984 ) . It contains 47 chapters in which Brunson recalls his days and life on the road . ) Following `` My Story '' is a history of Texas Hold'em by Crandell Addington which is n't , and then there is the chapter that could actually be considered part of a course in power poker . This would be 43 tips from Mike Caro cribbed from his lectures and books . However the tips are hardly `` '' for SuperSystem2 as claimed . Beginning with Caro 's cute but now very , `` In the beginning , everything was even money , '' or all of the tips have been recycled . For example , Tip # 18 , page 146 , `` WHEN A FREQUENT BETTOR CHECKS TO YOU ... do n't bluff '' is just about the as Tip # 10 `` Seldom bluff if bluffers have checked into you '' found on page 137 in Caro 's Fundamental Secrets of Winning Poker ( 1996 ) . In fact Caro even recycles his `` '' tips in this very book . Tip # 31 says that PLAYERS STARING AWAY ... are almost always more than players staring at you , '' while Tip # 40 says in part that `` OPPONENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BET OR RAISE IF THEY ARE : ... ( 3 ) staring away . '' Jennifer Harman 's chapter on limit hold'em is so that it 's . There 's not even a hint of anything . There are a number of books on the market that cover the ground much more thoroughly . I especially recommend Small Stakes Hold'em : Winning Big with Expert Play ( 2004 ) by Ed Miller , David Sklansky and Mason Malmuth or anything by Sklansky . Also her insistence on referring to hands backwards , `` '' ( e.g. , on 252 ) instead of `` 76 '' is annoying and to a convention . And the caricatures by Russ Braun ! They are so and flattering that each may have passed inspection by the subject 's mother . Comparing these to the witty and work by Stan Hunt in the is like comparing a cliche to something and . Brunson does n't even look like himself . Here he 's just a , smiling , boy kind of guy -- except in the , , drawing gracing page 7 which WAS drawn by Stan Hunt , copied from the book . are the chapters on Omaha and Stud Eight-or-Better . However , although Brunson has Bobby Baldwin billed as his author of the Omaha Eight-or-Better chapter , actually it was written ( as acknowledged ) by Mark Gregorich . He does a job of introducing the game and giving some of the strategies , and I 'm he is a player , but what about Bobby Baldwin ? Well , as CEO of Mirage Corporation and President of the Bellagio Hotel and Casino , Bobby is far , far too to write the chapter himself . So he just lent his name and his supervision . Can you spell R-I-P-O-F-F ? Perhaps the most part of the book is Doyle 's chapter on no limit hold'em . It is little than a reprise of the chapter in the book published 28 years ago . Also recycled is the section on `` Names of Various Hold'em Hands '' on pages 628 and 629 . The references to Raquel Welch ( `` 38 '' ) and Broderick Crawford ( `` '' ) seem than a out of touch . Indeed , this book is tribute to Brunson and the success he and the book achieved . And that is a shame , because this book is billed as an event in the history of the publication of books on poker when in fact it is something hastily put together to flatter Brunson and , hopefully , the pocketbook of those involved . One thing : there is a Glossary , for beginners , which is okay as it defines things a `` Deuce , '' `` Flush , '' `` Four of a Kind , '' etc. , but seems a for `` A Course in Power Poker . '' though is this definition of a `` Deck '' : `` A term often used to describe the deck by players who feel they 're not getting enough or winning hands . '' Players may indeed remark that `` the deck is , '' but the origin of the term comes from the fact that a deck used by cheaters that is switched into the game tends to be `` '' to the touch since it has not been handled since it was stacked . line : pass\", \"Disappointing with a capital quot ; D quot ; I 'm in a mood today , and feeling -- hence the two stars .

Lies are what `` slips '' and `` enabling '' and `` '' and those catch words that describe continued misery and failure . Recovery is nearly without honesty . So , can we look at this man 's `` memoir '' and expect it to offer anything of value ? It 's poorly constructed , , and . Even if Oprah had n't exposed him , the writing takes the tone of `` whoppers '' like Frey 's account of the drug house visit in which he `` rescues '' Lilly . reviewers and Smoking Gun have written about the episodes one by one , and I ca n't improve on that . Suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more than a soap opera . Story lines in a soap may look like life to one who is isolated from life , the way A Million Little Pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by addiction . A addict with delusion could be misdirected from a course of treatment with result .

This book has one 50 page chapter which is - the recap of the Thompson `` Shot heard around the world '' homerun . If you are a baseball fan as I am , that ( barely ) made the book worthwhile . The 700 pages are , , and really . You come away thinking `` I really do n't care bout this stuff '' - I do n't care about the dynamics of trash , about J Edgar Hoover 's bathroom habits , Klara Sax 's depression and annoying infatuations about roof tops , about characters that just do n't have depth to really care about . At the end , even potentially characters like Albert ( the one on the baseball quest ) become to bear . The book in fact had the feel of going to a citizen home . I read this book , as perhaps others did , expecting a book about the mafia or about figures in the underworld . What I got was a book with a chapter , some tidbits here and there about how life used to be in the 50 's ( fear of weapons , duck and cover classroom exercies ) , and a lot of knowledge about the trash business . The `` '' epilogue , as reviewers call it , really does no justice to a reader who has spent so time toiling over Delillo 's story telling . I am with stream of consciousness writing , or chapters , or even chapters , but the methods used in book served no purpose than to make the reading . Was this book about how our lives are versus the things that occur around us ? Or how each of us is on an quest ? Or that the 50's-60's-70's-80 's were just years of fear , and the 90 's are years of greed ? I am still , I still do n't think any of these themes came across well . Please - not pretending to be a sophisticate , , or - but this book is really not worth the time or effort . You can be staisfied by a number of books , including the `` The Corrections '' by Franzen or `` The Cold Six Thousand '' by Ellroy which cover a period or themes and do not make you so frustrated or disappointed at the end . Read the chapter , then put the book down or you will be sorely and have wasted an lot of time .\", 'Bias Was Off-Putting Dr. Northrup provides women with information about their bodies , stages of life and procedures .

I 've read three King books that have had the passages with depictions of horror , doom , and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story . This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really and . And this is exactly what `` Insomnia '' is . This is n't a spoiler , just the author 's note : at the end of the book we read 10 , Nov 10 , three years in which King took to write this book . Three years which were evidently wasted . The King books I 've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification . `` Insomnia 's '' Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with . He is , kind , has gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and . His counterpart Lois Chasse does n't come across as . Instead she serves as a character who has no flair or identity than being in love with Ralph . King does n't usually do that with his characters . characters with roles in this book come across as and , like Ed and Helen Deepenau , the three bald doctors , and Ralph 's confidantes . Then there 's the abortion mess . This issue crumbles midway and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story . Though King does provide an and seemingly commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker ( albeit with a tranparently slant ) , it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no than a story device . I gave the book two stars because I am an writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are to utilize as part of a writer 's arsenal . The devices were and all thru the reading I asked myself , 'How is King going to get through this ? ' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert 's narration ( via third person ) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance . It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story , he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him . This is a tool for a beginning writer , but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning . One thing , the villians just do n't work . They are not frightening , they are not , they are not or malign . Three doctors with scalpels and scissors ? Their defining characteristics are being and does that really frighten anyone ? The villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his madness . Then there 's the Crimson King , the mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most , scenes ever rendered . I rest my case .\", 'Slightly Disappointed - Review Edited I bought the book on the basis of the reviews and on a read of a copy a friend owned .

'' Orwell wrote the review in the `` Observer , '' London April 9,1944 . Hayek , mentions this fact as a footnote in chapter 17 of his book , `` The Constitution of Liberty '' published in 1960 , as evidence of the disillusionment of intellectuals , when they were confronted with the observation that individualism and socialism were mutually . Those intellectuals had not accepted the proposition when advanced by Karl Mannheim in his book , `` Man and Society in an Age of Reconstrucion '' ( 1940 ) . Mannheim had been a opponent of socialism , but Orwell had only been converted after being exposed to `` The Road to Serfdom . '' By 1960 , when Orwell had become a world renowned author and opponent of Big Brother doublespeak , Hayek recognized that the proponents of socialsm which was dying as a ideal , were now introducing the concept of the welfare state . While virtually everyone today have been effected by Orwell 's works and his prescient warnings about Big Brother , how of us are of Hayek 's infulence on him ? `` The Constitution of Liberty '' provides its readers with an wealth of knowledge , of which this one footnote is only a example . Each reader is bound to be effected in one way or another by the knowledge imparted to them , and this is one of the lessons to be learned about `` liberty '' which requires the `` rule of Law '' to exist in today 's society , but that Rule of Law must be . The failure of today 's inteligencia is to fail to fully comprehend the meaning of liberty and its necessity in a world of confusion from the confrontation of competing civilizations . Unfortunately , Hayek is no longer to help guide us through the millenium . Fortunately , he has left us a volume of work , perhaps more today than it was when written years ago . While `` The Constitution of Liberty '' is in itself , it should be kept as a reference book . Hayek 's works , `` The Road to Serfdom '' and his volume , `` Conceit-the Evils of Socialism '' published in 1980 is a continuation of Hayek 's life discertation on the evolution of mankind 's growth from a tribal , society which did not require man to understand or protect Liberty , to a group of city-states that prospered because of the Liberties protected in Athens , but only moderately , so that a and wise philosopher as Aristotle would believe that freedom could only exist as far as a man could yell . Hayek 's understanding that Civilization has prospered from individualism , that it has grown and prospered from the freedom to travel , to trade , to exchnge property , material , and . He explains why man must be , that humans progress from trial and error , not from conceited belief that one way or another way is . That to be and liberated is to be to make mistakes and government should exist to protect individuals'rights to make mistakes while they attempt to profit in their ideals and beliefs .\", \"Awful This has to be one of the most books I have ever read .

Second of all , the product is just a version of a spreadsheet . I could literally use Excel or MS Access to catalog my books just as well as this software . You actually have to input EVERY piece of data associated with a book . There is no excuse for anyone with an Internet connection to have to manually input book data .

DETAILS ! It felt as if the author was trying to prove how intelligent he is , boasting of his accomplishments and how he 's almost . His failures were blamed on people out to get him for reasons . Lets say it for what it is : A man who looks kind of and a bit ` ' ( Unabomber ) gets a job in a institution , he rides his bike in , hangs out in the shadows getting dressed , does n't socialize - and no one wants him around .

I wished he had focused in detail about his feelings , emotions and behaviors when he was gain a understanding of what shaped him into the person he is now . The book was written as if he fast-forwarded through his youth and got stuck on ` pause ' when he got to college .

Kingdome Come is an Elseworlds ( what if ) story set approximately years after the retirement of Superman and subsequently nearly every hero . As the story unfolds , the reason Superman quit is revealed . A hero named Magog killed the Joker and was put on trial for murder . When the public cried out for his aquittal and it was granted , Superman quit in disgust . The results of the choosing a hero that would kill are very in the future . The children of the heroes we know are everywhere . They hold society in a state of terror as they enforce justice and fight each in the way they see , destroying property and causing chaos . Wonder Woman approaches Superman in his exile in the wastleland that is Kansas and asks him to return and lead the heroes in returning order . When Superman returns to the eye in issue # 2 , it sets into motion an Apocalypse as described in the Bible , but with Superheroes being the catalyst . The Justice League rounds up every violent super human and puts them into a prison designed by Mister Miracle ( The world 's escape artist ) called the Gulag . All this is shown from the viewpoint of Norman McCray , a pastor and friend of the Golden Age Sandman . He is led on his journey by the Spectre ( DC 's Angel of Death ) I absolutely love this story by Mark Waid , the way he wraps characters and events into a Biblical epic is . The art by Alex Ross is jaw-dropping in it 's realism . The characters are in their depiction , especially the Flash- a blur wrapped in lightning wearing a helmet . Issue # 3 ends in a cliff-hanger with all the villains rioting and breaking out of the Gulag . As Superman races to the scene , he is thrown to the ground by the person that could , Captain Marvel . I still remember waiting for issue # 4 to come out . The scene between Captain Marvel and Superman was voted # 1 by Wizard magazine and is worth the price of this trade alone . Even without this scene , I would rate this as one of the mini-series ever , but with it Kingdom Come is # 1 .

Burke 's characters , with the exception of the always and touching Cletus Purcell , are wearing and becoming less and less . Dave Robicheaux becomes and preachy in each novel . His tirades would make any Prohibition era preacher proud . Burke has fallen into a trap of using the imagery and phrasing again and again , and it makes the reader wonder if he is n't cutting and pasting paragraphs repeatedly .

But monsters ? Centaurs ? I mean , the story of Sappho 's life is not the story of The Odyssey and for the life of me I do n't understand why author Erica Jong decided to give her readers a combination of Greek heroine and Clash of the Titans .

So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man 's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million Italians .

Anthropologists have been concerned , for years , in getting the quot ; inside view quot ; -- the view of a culture as seen by the person within it . While Barzini is , he tries to visualize Italians as seen by visitors , then explain to those of us not enough to travel there , why they are as visitors see them , or why they are not as foreigners may think . This is not a gambit . Cultures are based on factors -- like history , patterns , religion , family , etc. -- -but the results are just that , . Barzini covers topics -- the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality ; the family vs. the state ; modes of achieving success ; the split ; Sicily and the Mafia ; and , the tragedy of Italy 's domination by foreigners . But nothing really connects . There are only , impressions , nothing very to grasp . The reader is left with a handful of stereotypes . Barzini is at his when describing the lives and operandi of characters in history . These sections were and . But his portrayal of quot ; character quot ; is , contradictory , and ultimately , unconvincing .

Even then , disagreements on the apportionment of blame will likely continue on for decades after . Given the interest in the conflict and the nature of the negotiations , works exploring the climax at Camp David remain . Some Mr. Swisher 's work because he was not in fact part of the negotiating team , but instead was at Camp David only for negotiations . That seems to me . Clayton Swisher clearly did `` work '' to prepare this text ; sadly both his rather bias and almost desire to settle scores renders what could have been an work at suspect . Mr. Swisher 's book follows on the heels of Dennis Ross 's `` The Missing Peace '' and , given Mr. Ross 's involvement in the negotiations ; no one could be blamed for looking at works as well . However , Mr. Swisher spends much of his time looking to lay the blame at Mr. Ross 's feet , even when he makes claims that others at Camp David , then Mr. Swisher directly contradict his statements . for example is made in this work of Mr. Ross 's change of `` Jerusalem '' to `` Jerusalem '' in a draft as if this caused the breakdown of the agreement . Unfortunately , Ross 's change in fact was a return to an draft after being changed by Robert Malley , a member of the US team and now often a talking head representing the point of view , who made the alteration without consulting any of the parties . Malley has never denied this . Moreover , days would pass before the negotiations actually broke down . Swisher 's target , perhaps seeking to sell books by putting forward a contradictory point of view , shifts the blame wherever he can to Israel and the US negotiating team . While an effort might well be , Mr. Swisher often twists facts , making excuses for gaffs while blowing facts out of all proportion . For example , Mr. Swisher brushes aside the days lost when Mr. Arafat and the team insisted that Jews had no link to Jerusalem or the Temple Mound -- a position farcical on its face -- as posturing . However , he never mentions that ideas , undermining the people very claim to the Land , serve only to inflame the parties and make agreement almost . Nor does Swisher ever consider the Palestinians failure to negotiate in faith , treating every Israeli offer simply as a base line , rather than offering any proposals of their . Again , even Robert Malley concedes that this strategy by the Palestinians doomed Camp David from the start . Swisher 's dismissal of all Israeli concerns reaches a crescendo when he simply casts aside as Israel 's interest and the Palestinian 's refusal of any compromise for the `` right of return , '' or the claim that all Palestinian who left the area of Israel and all their descendants must have a immigrate to Israel , a held by no people . As to the fact that this would lead to the destruction of the State and that the Palestinians are thus expecting Israel to commit suicide , on this problem Mr. Swisher remains . Lastly , one can not help but marvel at Mr. Swisher 's coverage of the events after Camp David . That Yasser Arafat led a war against Israel rather than offering an proposal for peace is dismissed . Mr. Swisher combs through events searching for , magnifying , and twisting any event that will make Israel look , while at the time minimizing or even ignoring the waves of terrorists who have murdered hundreds of Israeli civilians in blood . Mr. Swisher even parrots points of propaganda so thoroughly disproved that even leaders no mention them , as the claim of massacres during operations in Jenin , which exhaustive study long ago proved to be nothing than a fabrication . Curiosity will cause readers to ask why Mr. Swisher takes this extremely view . Fortunately , he lays out his rather point of view at the very beginning of the book by writing the following , `` The reason for Arab and Muslim anger against America has been and remains support for Israel 's oppression of the Palestinians . '' Again , one can only muse as to why Mr. Swisher does not take Osama bin Laden at his word when he spoke shortly after 9/11 that his manifests from the presence of Christian soldiers in the heart of Islamic lands like Saudi Arabia and later Iraq . Surely neither the bombings in Madrid or more recently in London had anything to do with Israel , but it seems for Mr. Swisher 's world view , it is at the step of the state where all blame is to be laid .\", \"Oh boy , `` lets understand the terrorist '' garbage The religion of peace is at it again ! In response to the popes words , muslims all over the world respond with violence , destruction , rage , hatred , burning down buildings , burning effigies , issuing fatwas against the pope , and even shooting a 70 year nun in the back . Wow , peace from a religion of `` peace '' . If Islam is a religion of peace , then all the guns in the world are flowers , and every bomb , a feathery pillow . Violence for words . Destruction for speech . PLEASE ! This is a religion of war , and bereft mindless 70 year bags like Noam have begun to lose a lot of function with age . This bag of a man gives Muslims passes and blames America . Question : When will the world start holding to account the actions of Muslims , and stop blaming others , as Bush , America , the Pope , or God knows who else ? How people will die at the hand of Muslims before the world finally , and for the time , holds the Muslims accountable for their actions , rather than someone else ? Well Im sick of the left defending this cesspool of Islamofacism . Im tired of the media beating up on Israel and coming to the side of tyrants who shoot 70 year nuns in the back in response to spoken words .

'' He goes on to claim that Shaara brings the war to `` pulsating life . '' I have even read a review that claimed this book was than Remarque 's All Quiet on the Front . I must have been reading a book . The chapter , The Replacement , is a story . After reading it , I had hight expectations for the book . Unfortunately , it falls apart after that beginning and it is a affair that completely lacks any sense of a narrative from a point of view . And , the history reads like an 8th grade textbook . His style is to give life to people that actually lived . They are flatly presented and there is no sense of really caring about what happens to them . After the story of the chapter , the book delves into a story of the flying aces , interspersed with summaries of events that do little than ruin the flow of the story . It frequently feels like the book is written for people who are to read a history book . Shaara does n't even begin dealing with the trench warfare of the war until the 1918 's , when the Americans , focusing , as I noted before , primarily on the air war that occurred in the years of the war . I should point out that the air war would be interesting reading in a book of its . Here , however , it seems to reflect that the author did not deem the ground warfare fought by non-Americans worthy of a story . Or was too to research the events enough to write about the ground war from the or perspective . And , I have no particularly problem with him focusing on the perspective on the war , but then why bother with writing anything prior to our entry ? I suppose a book does n't sell as well . For those in fiction , I would recommend Bernard Cornwall 's work . And , perhaps , Shaara can learn a bit from him\", \"Great for philosophy , but does n't inspire !

Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the two chapters of this book . The characters personalities were wavering in book 5 , in this they completely vanished or mutated . I 'll only be getting the 7th one because it 's the one and I 've read this far so I might as well go the way . In books one through four the trio of Harry , Ron , and Hermione were characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day . Book 5 had them doing angsting and screaming than mystery solving , and more than day saving . Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a job miming the motions the characters would have done . This book Harry seemed to care more about romance . A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and moments on par with the of fanfiction ; which had no background or build up from books . A character from the background , whom Harry barely even notices all through the five books , is suddenly the most and girl in the school in fashion . characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance , none of which bore any revelance to plot or story . Harry also had a decline in morality and intelligence . The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one mistake after another . The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying , frozen in a position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose , under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly episode with Malfoy . As to the plot of the book . Poorly done . Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me . of the 'revealations ' in the book revealed nothing not already known or from information , and the culmination of what Harry was did n't amount to anything . My opinion : Do n't bother to read book 4 if you 're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization . A very book\", \"reading this is to banging your head against a wall The premise of this story started off smartly . I was drawn in as a reader as Case set up an unusaul plot where the protagonist is in Russia to cover a story only to be pushed aside while his sources of information are taken away . But from this point onwards the story becomes painfully as time after time Case takes the rout . Finally the story completely falls apart and it was like when you watch one of those really action flicks where the hero saves the day time after time and its so that you get a headache . I have read one Case book I think , his `` Kingdome Come '' that was written under a psudo name , or maybe Case is the psudo name , I 'm not . But what I am trying to say here is that Come ' was much than 'First Horseman . ' Its still a corny , but it reads like a more Ludlum\", \"Worthless and Disproven Keynes was no doubt an economist . His theories and 'expertise ' on economics influenced the Deal policies of the United States and the wealth redistribution schemes like IMF . However , his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of Keynesian ideas that wrecked so havoc on the U.S. particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation ( an recession with unemployment which was theoretically accordingly to Keynesism . ) We have Keynes to thank for budget deficits and the idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the government .

The feel or atmosphere just is n't quite there . Any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away , flaws that distract and damage the work .

The Hawks apparently are from Atlanta , but an Atlanta team , Braves or Hawks , whichever , would not be playing the Yankees interleague on the to day of the season . Finally , when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game , he does so in the bull pen down the field line in Yankee Stadium -- not on the mound on the field .

'' Understanding Qutb 's radicalization of Islam is to understanding why Ayman al-Zawahiri and Usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were ducks until the USA found a use for them as an enemy . What can not be neglected is the myths spread about the United States by the Neoconservatives and followers of Leo Strauss . The United States is not a unique and snowflake . The idea of freedom was decried by Strauss as destructive of the society of the USA and he told his followers to keep the public in line with myths about US exceptionalism . After the the Soviet Union was kicked out of Afghanistan , both Qutb and Strauss ' followers believed they were the cause of it . Since the Cold War the US has been working off of the `` friend and enemy '' model of policy formulated by Carl Schmitt and 9/11 presented the US with what Schmitt called a `` state of exemption .

But somehow it did n't work . I get the sense that her heart was n't really in this book . Maybe because the trips were taken over a span of five years , and cobbled together ?

How well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you ? How well can you predict what people in your country will do ? Would every Italian , if they could write well , have written the book as Mr. Barzini ? I seriously doubt it . So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man 's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million Italians .

Anthropologists have been concerned , for years , in getting the quot ; inside view quot ; -- the view of a culture as seen by the person within it . While Barzini is , he tries to visualize Italians as seen by visitors , then explain to those of us not enough to travel there , why they are as visitors see them , or why they are not as foreigners may think . This is not a gambit . Cultures are based on factors -- like history , patterns , religion , family , etc. -- -but the results are just that , . Barzini covers topics -- the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality ; the family vs. the state ; modes of achieving success ; the split ; Sicily and the Mafia ; and , the tragedy of Italy 's domination by foreigners . But nothing really connects . There are only , impressions , nothing very to grasp . The reader is left with a handful of stereotypes . Barzini is at his when describing the lives and operandi of characters in history . These sections were and .

While an author can occasionally pull off a story with a connection to 'real life ' ( See Nelson De Mille 's Fall ' ) , Hillerman fails here .

This is a and story , and Morita tells it with flair . Then , unfortunately , the spiral begins . Morita consistently takes his experience at Sony and assumes that every company operates the way , which is a fantastically assertion ( as the years of Japan 's seemingly recession have shown ) .

For example , Morita spends a deal of words attacking the excess of lawyers in the United States . While this can , of course , sometimes be a problem , it also gives U.S. consumers a way to protect themselves . Japan 's consumers , on the hand , without an court system , are almost completely at the mercy of bureaucrats and executives . Complaints about products or chemicals in drinking water are simply ignored , because they lack any threat of action .

And , of course , who is the ` life judge ' and does this judge have the authority of the state to take something from someone ( who has a life that is deemed too rewarding ) for someone who has life that is too .

'' But the literalist reading this book need make no effort , when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of Christians up to heaven in the `` Rapture . '' Though the characters and their roles are , the book specifically references the passages for the believer . The story line opens with the moment of discovery after the mass Rapture event , and the remainder is a melodrama concluding with born-again conversions . In the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not to the idea of progress toward a utopia driven by advances and the cooperation of people of all traditions . Instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a pessimism about prospects for reform . Billy Graham 's biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham 's `` evangelism '' for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing problems . Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the `` Tribulation Force '' or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell 's Moral Majority . They are also committed to an vision of the end of the world and are to institutions as the United Nations . Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the of the United Nations . The U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially , while evangelicals and liberals - e.g . Baptists , Lutherans , Presbyterians , Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines . data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism 's growing appeal in reaction to society . I see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the `` left behind '' in the backwash of the flows of change in society , and as Christians who believe it is better to stay behind .

Why did I give it two stars instead of one then ? Well , it does have some parts .

He also presents some convincing data ( gathered by people ) that use of the internet for socializing does not suck people into an world , alienating them from the world of interaction ; this happens in the case of a people , but people use the internet to enhance their already existing relationships . The rest of the book basically argues that the network format of the internet is reshaping the rest of society in its image , with everything from business to governments to movements adopting a network form in response to the rise of this technology . This is , frankly , reductionism . It does n't even stand up to a test of chronology -- a lot of the developments that Castells argues are driven by the internet predate the explosion of usage in the . As Castells himself admits , businesses were already taking on of a network form before the internet appeared time on the scene , and movement scholars have shown the is of movements . On top of this , Castells shows an enthusiasm for all things networked , whether they be corporations or the movements that oppose these corporations . I 'm really at a loss to understand how one can enthuse about both of these phenomena .

In books one through four the trio of Harry , Ron , and Hermione were characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day . Book 5 had them doing angsting and screaming than mystery solving , and more than day saving . Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a job miming the motions the characters would have done . This book Harry seemed to care more about romance . A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and moments on par with the of fanfiction ; which had no background or build up from books . A character from the background , whom Harry barely even notices all through the five books , is suddenly the most and girl in the school in fashion . characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance , none of which bore any revelance to plot or story . Harry also had a decline in morality and intelligence . The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one mistake after another .

The performances can either be with individuals , or groups of people , and they can be performing conciously or unconciously . ( end of charicature ) There are arguments , obviously , and the statement `` we can draw a with situations '' is of the content of the book , which i dont like to gloss over with a sentence . But the question here is , is the view worthwhile ? My answer : No . Social interaction is a phenomena that cant possibly be summed up with a signle metaphor . Yes , some interaction is like a performance , where indivudals are intentionally making impressions on one another . Yes , some behavior can arise from beliefs . However , interaction is exactly the way we see it , conciously controlled , , interaction with individuals ; it is not some kind of performance with the purpose of creating a `` reality '' . I hope my view of the book is so that the biases on the part of my review can be sorted out : the book is a waste of time . Where the author is , the statement is little than sense . Where the author goes outside of sense , he 's , sometimes plainly so . This book is part of the tradition in sociology of thinking that society pulls the wool over each individuals eyes , that reality is a construct with no purpose than control ( here the wool is the performance , and the control has to do with impressions ... but this quickly degenerates into an mess of assertions ) . There is no support given for of the claims . Where `` evidence '' is given , the evididence is so heavily intepreted that it fails to correspond to facts in the world but rather to facts about the views of the reporter . Where there is no correspondence to the world there is no truth . sources of sociology are cited , but this is more like bullying . Saying that some author , which also didnt have any support for his claims , agrees with you is just to bully your reader into acepting your claims . The claims in the book have no application in the world , but only serve to intepret situations differently , and in opinion , less correctly . Nothing said here will lead to predictions about behavior or a understanding of psychology . In , this isnt a study at all . My qualm with the book deserves its paragraph , the use of language . The example is the definitions given at the end of the introduction `` A performance may be defined as all of the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of the participants '' ( 15 ) . This is a definition . Me breathing while work is a performance , it changes the percentages of O2 and CO2 in the atmosphere near my co-workers . Me staring into space is a performance , people see me stare into space and are therefore . Infact , me simply existing is a performance , since my existance causes a effect on the participants , as well as influencing them to create beliefs about me existing . Its as if Goffman created a definition for performance which included all actions taken by any person , and then wrote a book about how all actions taken by any person fall under the category of performance . He didnt . He used a word that we associate with behavior ( performance ) and defined it in a way no one is used to . Then he used alot of word play to show that behavior has no substance , its all for the purpose of maintaining reality . I hope this very example shows the use of language that is to Goffman and sociology more generally . So an ode to sociology is in order ... actually no it isnt . Why wont this subject go away ? This book is an part of sociology , and it espouses the methods and style of researchers and writers by being an work within the tradition . The methods are ; the style is . Like it or hate it , sociology is a part of thought .

I would love to read a book on Barry Bonds , I hate cheerleader type books about players but I also hate ones as well . The only things he really has to say about Bonds are about his baseball brain and his relationship with the Marge ( whom he then sarcastically remarks that Bonds was only her player ) . The book covers a variety of topics , some are puzzeling . While of the book bashes Barry Bonds is also bashes his ex-wife for being an dancer . I was pretty to read that , I was a fan of Pearlman but I thought he had more class then that . This book came out right after ( or because of ) Game of Shadows . This book here actually praises Game of Shadows while bashing Bonds for activities when 3 weeks after the book came out the writers of Book of Shadows are being subpeoned for illegally optaining information , guess that backfired Pearlman . In fact Game of Shadows may be taken off the shelves soon as well . The book uses sources ( there is a reference sheet in the back , of those articles all include quotes from sources ) , so its really to take alot of the harsh quotes that Bonds says seriously because it is . The book pretty discredits itself at the end when Pearlman proclaims that sports writers do not actually try or want to dig up dirt on people , they like to find stories . That quote alone will have any Bonds hater rolling eyes at the sheer stupidity of it . Sports writing has became essectially a tabliod now . Even Skip Bayless publically admitted that writers do that . So once again , the problem is that it fails to stay on ground . This would be like writing a book about Babe Ruth and only mentioning that he beat up umpires , ran into the stands to attack people , slept with hookers , drank all the time , was mean to Lou Gherig , etc . While that may be it would also only tell one part of the story and would be a waste , just like this', \"No Substance to 'Substance' I was disappointed with this purchase .

As you read the book , the answer comes quickly , before you 're even very far into the `` A 's '' ... apparently he did n't . I was repeatedly disappointed by the cursory , often definitions which accompany of the 2000 terms Grimes presents . The line or two of each are accompanied by are often and sometimes down misleading . The introduction builds up the book as a tool to help we folk through the growing complexities of food buying and eating . In a world no longer dominated by a terms we are led to believe that this book will bridge the gap between cooking books ( say , from before 1990 ) and the state of culinaria . Why then are so of the terms defined in an , even archaic mind-set ? Take the term `` sugar '' . This book says it is `` or partially refined sugar '' , a definition all well and perhaps 200 years ago . Today brown sugar is almost always made from sugar with a molasses syrup and colorings added back to it - a very thing indeed , and Grimes should know the difference . The are examples in the vein . Additionally , Grimes give us `` food lists '' scattered periodically throughout the book but provides only support for the words used in them . For example , there is a list of Varieties of Apples . 48 varieties are listed but when one wants information on them it is often . `` Red Delicious '' apples have an definition in the `` R '' section but what about the more varieties like `` Sundowner '' , or `` Lodi '' apples ? No mention of them can be found in the book . There is also a list of `` Fish and Seafood '' but if you are intrigued by what the `` Geoduck '' or `` Sprat '' listed might be , you 're out of luck ( without running to a REAL dictionary ) . The ( if limited ) spots in the book are the articles on food etymology and history . There are 7 of them ( reprints from publications and authors ) that are each and . Grimes would have done much better to have put together a collection of these gems and left the definitions to those more by the subject . My guess is that the brevity of the definitions ( leading to rampant deficiencies ) was , perhaps , an attempt at simplicity but the `` '' of the book is insulting to anything but the most reader . I know that Grimes , a restaurant reviewer for the New York Times , must know a lot about food than this book makes him sound . Grimes is listed as the `` editor '' of this work ( along with a number of others ) and it defies why he would allow his name used as the primary .

I know this will outrage some Patterson readers but I 'm not much of a fan of Alex Cross who frankly I find as hell . As mediocre as Patterson often is as an author , readers should beware , London Bridges is especially . The reads like an abridgement , moving at a pace without ever generating any suspense . The premise is - criminals with names join forces to blackmail world leaders ( sounds like the plot for an Austin Powers movie - without any of the humour ) . Patterson is not remotely qualified to enter the thriller market . An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year does n't have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a thriller .

Secondly , there is a LOT of content to trawl through to get , in my opinion , a pieces of interesting material . Finally , the theme or accusation that without IBM the holocaust may not have happened , or would not have been so , is ( again in my opinion ) flawed .

This book contains some information and some insights into the mass psychology of booms , bubbles , and busts . Prechter should have left it at that . Instead , he offers up predictions . mistake .

If you see or waves than he does in any given market move , you just do n't understand that there can only be 5 waves to the top of a bull market . He 's imposing his theory on the market , but surprisingly enough , the market does n't care . It does whatever it wants , in however waves it wants , and Bob has been very frustrated at the market 's behavior lately . He got in his career , but it seems he 's been fairly consistently getting the market since missing the '87 crash . Any superstitution can `` seem '' to work if you only look at its happenstance accuracies and disregard its failures . Keep looking for numbers of waves and Fibonacci ratios and you 'll find what you 're looking for . Pick any set of numbers or patterns or wave counts , and you 'll find those too . The market does n't care about any of those things , though . It 's nothing than an aggregation of billlions of choices , which are influenced by an number of factors none of us can ever understand fully . University studies of investing methods have found that Elliott Wave , like , is no than stock selection . If Prechter had chosen the random method , he and his followers would at have a chance of keeping pace with the market . Unfortunately , he has been getting everything from the Dow , to oil ( he thought it was going to $ 10 ) , to gold ( he did n't think it could break $ 400 ) , to deflation ( the `` deflation '' scare ended shortly after this book came out ) WRONG in the couple of years . He apparently STILL believes that the Dow will go to 400 ( not 4,000 but FOUR HUNDRED ) because his charts tell him it should ( they 've been telling him that since about 1990 , actually ) . Prechter does n't understand demographics or economics or markets or the system , all of which render `` Dow 400 '' among the of forecasting absurdities -- unless you believe a asteroid will hit and wipe out two thirds of the population ( I do n't think Prechter is counting on that ) . Our economy may have a crisis soon , perhaps by the end of the decade . It will most likely be spurred on by inflation and rising interest rates .

This book came out near the bottom of the stock bear market , just in time for a reader to short stocks as they began a bull market . How . While promoting the book , Prechter said it was `` '' that stocks would `` crash '' in 2003 . He said that 2003 would be `` the year yet '' for bears ( sellers ) . Late into 2003 , when it was that the market had proven him , Prechter declared on a radio show that by the end of 2004 , the Dow would `` certainly '' fall below 5,000 . again !

It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become in the plot . Another disappointment is Koontz 's recycling of elements from novels : ( 1 ) plucky , highly disabled girl ( the protagonist in `` The Hideaway '' had almost deformities and personality ) , ( 2 ) devoted , canine companions , ( 3 ) guys driving around in pimped-out RVs , and ( 4 ) evil bioethicists . The Leilani character is patently . She conveniently has a genius IQ , but that does not make the absurdly manner in which she speaks any more . I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot . Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children , and this book is no exception . Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds ; the latter , however , does not justify his habit of making children talk like genius adults . Dean heaps the hardships on Leilani , with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker , Texas Ranger . In case you miss the anvils , you are supposed to really , really like her and fear for her safety . I do n't know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics , but he has a terribly view of the field , taking an sect of it to represent the viewpoint of the field . Further , he states times that these bioethics principles are being taught to students at universities ( who will have to pay for their involvement with bioethics ) -- as a student , I can assure you that this is patently . That Koontz could be so on a topic that directly relates to the motive is disconcerting and makes an already book even harder to swallow . The issue is Koontz 's near-deification of dogs , particularly Retrievers , which is a motif in his works . It is and unintentionally to an almost degree . His obsession with dogs and their powers borders on the ( and I like dogs ) . This novel probably features the most example of Koontz 's tendency to create overly , endings .

In the end I felt McKnight 's trashing of the already government provision of services may not be altogether to communities . He sidesteps concerns of capital mobility and exploitation and the effects wrought by years of discrimination . debate over when and where and how programs can be is aside as well , since in McKnight 's picture , programs and the service providers are , in fact , the vilains and culprits for of what ails society . One of the fallacies that seems to be perpetuated in this book is that service professionals are not to be both and caring - the two are deemed mutually . Mcknights views resonate with employers ' caring - conveniently invoked every time a healthcare worker tries to claim she does care about patients but is still entitled to a living wage or , perhaps , health insurance . What is implied is that communities will readily and ably take up the reign of providing for themselves and their members when denied more services . It seems that communities had no problems before the programs to solve them came into being . In this , I think I see McKnight is invokeing an notion of an society at an time ; maybe his argument would have seemed more in a time when families were less geographically and may have constituted an unit , when the lived lives and were less themselves with more children to care for them , and the activities were more functionally . But McKnight 's model for today 's cure does n't seem to fit today 's conditions . On the hand , McKnights solutions may be the ones in a society where budget cuts and elimination of services seem the trend .\", \"Somebody Stop Me ... ... .. ... ... ..from reading Danielle Steel .

He tries to be all things to all people saying both that he believes in competencies but wants to put inquiry first . Also , his language is inflated , and lacking in specificity . For example , he believes in building up the world of `` representations '' [ term ] yet insists on `` performances of understanding '' [ another term ] . Also , he has respect for the learner and differences , yet he is concerned about the `` position '' or `` situation '' or class dynamics in which the learning takes place . Thus , he fails to do justice either to the individual or to class , race , or gender . The role of leadership in learning is wholly ignored ; and responsibility is not explored . In , it is extremely to pin down Prof. Gardner . It would be kind to say he is . I hope it 's just not thinking . However , we can discern that he has a obsession with beauty , truth , and goodness .

Further , is Prof. Gardner really elitist than Hirsch as some have claimed ? I have found that the Harvard elite spend their lives trying to achieve and learn everything , and be on . Their lives are marked by ambition to the Nth degree ; yet , he debunks and content areas that traditionally have defined literacy at its . Thus , I find a dishonesty in Gardner 's presentation . Believe me , friends , I have taught students who have ideals , ideals and ideals , but know very , nor do they aspire to learn . If they have those ideals , and if they are and glib , will they be the leaders of tomorrow who are embraced by Prof. Gardner ? I find a tendency on Prof. Gardner 's part to oversimplify issues like the Holocaust , and to overcomplicate others like the nature of intelligence . The world is not waiting for the concept of intelligence to be . Am I oversimplifying when I think that there is something very awkward about saying that there is no difference in intelligence between Einstein and the custodian of my school ? Is this awkwardness because I am an elitist putting down the custodian ? Is it because of lack of intelligence that I am still in the grip of a definition of intelligence ? I do n't think so . Rather , we all know we are on each , and that everybody has some aptitudes or gifts they can express and be respected for , but trying to elevate this understanding to a level of truth or significance seems to me to be .

Kagan 's thought provoking book became extremely and received acclaim for its analysis of the deteriorating US-Europe relationship , not to mention its catchy and phrases systematically introduced throughout the slender yet captivating book . Kagan introduces chapters in his book , in order to deconstruct the underlying issues which he claims are causes of the ever widening divide between US and Europe . In the chapter `` The Power Gap '' , Kagan starts from World War I to understand the aversiveness Europe displays towards and wars . He argues that while both the World Wars weakened Europe tremendously ; they helped the US emerge as a power . He further elaborates on the might of the US in the chapter that follows - `` Psychologies of Power and Weakness '' . Kagan explains how lack of power can not only psychologies and ideologies , but change perspectives as well . He claims Europe 's paucity of power compels it to not only threats but ignore them all together and at the time try and counterbalance the US force by constructing a world which is governed by and methods . This chapter culminates into `` Hyperpussiance '' , a chapter in which Kagan discusses details of Kosovo and Bosnia , highlighting Europe 's failure and America 's effectiveness in handling the situation . He finally presents his argument in the chapters `` The Post Modern Paradise '' and `` The World America Made '' where Kagan states , `` Europe 's evolution into its state occurred under the mantle of the U.S. security guarantee and could not have occurred without it . '' Casting doubts on Europe 's intentions , Kagan centers his argument on the growing policies of Europe and questions the validity of terms as ` ' in his chapter `` Is It Still ` The West ' '' ? Finally , it seems Kagan provides a solution to this problem of the US- Europe divide in his concluding chapter , `` Adjusting to Hegemony '' , by simply stating one line - `` the task for both Europeans and Americans is to readjust to the reality of hegemony '' . This extremely book , as compared to the issue it addresses needs analysis and some examining . There are issues to be addressed in Kagan 's analysis and one might not be completely satisfied with claims , reasonings or the manner in which such a grave and topic is handled . While there is a tone of underlying bias ( in contrast to the opinion of a view that the author holds ) , Kagan manages to miss out some facts and figures , not to mention stark paradoxes , and the essay lacks citings . To start with , let me point out the contradictions in Kagan 's arguments , the presence of which highly undermines his claims , leaving the reader in a dilemma of either argument . Kagan claims , `` Europe 's weakness has understandably produced a interest in building a world where strength and power matter than and power ... rules of behavior '' ( pg.37 ) . He goes on to say , - `` Since Europeans lack the capacity to undertake actions , either individually or collectively as ` Europe , ' it is that they should oppose allowing others to do that they can not do themselves . `` ( pg.38 ) in contrast to `` ... Europe today has the wealth and capability to make itself of a world power in terms if Europe wanted to become that kind of world power '' ( ) . Kagan contradicts his views , stating times that Europe is militarily , nor does it have the capacity to build up its forces yet at the time , puts forth an argument of Europe 's capabilities of increasing its defense spending and might to match the US . In the chapter , Psychologies of Power and Weakness , Kagan 's one claim contradicts another which is made in the chapter as the reasoning for both his claims seem to be absolutely . He first explains Europe 's tolerance for threats is to its weakness and the past , which it has suffered from . He then metaphorically explains it by giving the example of a man with a knife and the one with a rifle having interpretations of the word ` threat ' when confronting a bear ( pg.31 ) . But again Kagan himself feels Europe can become a power as and when it wishes to , when he says `` They could easily spend twice as as they are currently spending on defense if they believed it to do so '' ( pg.54 ) . So this forces me to ask a question , would one be mauled by a bear if one could produce a rifle to prevent this misfortune ? So is n't it quite that Europeans feel , not because they `` ... enjoy the ` ride ' they have gotten under the security umbrella over the six decades '' ( pg.54 ) , but rather because there was and is no threat at all ? With the use of phrases as `` The Axis of Evil '' and `` States '' ( pg.30 ) , which Kagan uses to describe Iraq and Iran , not to mention his references to ` Weapons of Mass Destruction ' ( which he uses as a pretext to the war in Iraq ) , which still seem to be for some reason , he seems to perplex me by blatantly ignoring his creation . While Kagan maintains that Iraq was a threat and the US perceived it as one while Europe did not , he might want to explain as to why , in 1997 , he ( Kagan was the Director of the Project for the New American Century ) signed a document which justifies American occupation of the Middle-East , irrespective of threats from Iraq or Iran . `` The United States has for decades sought to play a more role in Gulf security . While the conflict with Iraq provides the justification , the need for a force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein ... From an perspective , the value of bases would endure even should Saddam pass from the scene . Over the term , Iran may well prove as a threat to U.S. interests in the Gulf as Iraq has . And even should relations improve ; retaining forces in the region would still be an element in U.S. security strategy given the interests in the region . `` ( - Rebuilding America 's Defenses - *1 ) This forces me to conclude that either the author has resorted to ` cherry picking ' of evidence or he suffers from amnesia . Some of his reasoning , analysis and analogies seem to be too . When explaining action , one can not justify it by saying , `` When you have a hammer , all problems start to look like nails '' . The author speaks about the nation 's ( US 's ) willingness to go to war simply because it has the ability and the capacity to do so . Without discussing a need or providing reasons for the use of aggression , the author seems to be in justifying use of force , simply because one has it . One aspect Kagan leaves out in his analysis are the and aspects of the feud . While I have discussed some aspects later in the review , one must note that Kagan does not mention the Kyoto Protocol ( apart from Clinton 's negotiation of it ( pg.45 ) ) . The US withdrawal from the Protocol had created problems and divisions between the two giants ( www.climnet.org - *2 ) . While there were issues that fanned the growing fire , disagreements over the Missile treaty for example , which Kagan conveniently sweeps under the carpet , needed to be addressed if one is discussing relations ( www.bbcnews.com - *3 , 4 ) For a book which covers issues from the World War II decade ( occasionally going back to ancient philosophy ) to the issues , 72 citations , from which are simply explanations ( for examples , see 19 , 20 , 22 ) , seem to be alarmingly , especially with the absence of some ones and not to mention , citations which wrongly allude to facts . Kagan mentions , `` As ` some ' Europeans put it , the division of labor consisted of the United States making the dinner and the Europeans doing the dishes '' ( pg.23 ) , yet he does not refer to any source for this statement . He says , `` The majority of Europeans always believed that the threat ( if any ) posed by Saddam was more than the risk of removing him '' along with alleging statements like , `` The rehabilitation and reintegration of Saddam Hussein 's Iraq is precisely what they ( Europe ) sought '' ( pg.44 ) , and again gives no source for the origin of these beliefs . Strangely , he supports one of his claims by stating in his supra note.20 , pg.30 , `` for that matter , this is also the view commonly found in textbooks '' . One might not generally expect to see puerile purporting evidence in a analysis of relations . Kagan at times jumps back to Athenian times and has injected philosophies in his essay . He mentions a number of times how Americans see the world from a perspective while Europeans are followers of policies . Kagan seems to have overlooked the fact , that though Hobbes had described the state of nature as that of `` all against all '' , the reason Hobbes justifies a sovereignty is to ensure peace on earth . Kagan conveniently cites Hobbes ( Hobbes theory itself was flawed as philosophers termed it as ` Hobbes Dilemma ' ) to justify aggression , but no where in Hobbes ' theory is justified by the sovereign ( Leviathan - Ch.17 ) . There are some conclusions Kagan draws which seem to be beliefs of an idealist living in a world where politics is as as religion . He concludes that while the US was providing `` security '' to Europe after the Cold War , `` ... America 's power and willingness to assume responsibility for protecting nations ... '' ( pg.34 ) has given Europe the opportunity to build up economically . Kagan asserts his point when he says , `` Given America 's willingness to spend so money protecting them , Europeans would rather spend their money on welfare programs , vacations and workweeks '' ( pg.54 ) . These are presentations of facts , which are of subjective , ideologies . I would like to put forth two points in order to accentuate the fallacy of these two statements . First , America 's interest in Europe was not to provide it with security whether before or after the Cold War . One must not confuse the fact that measures taken to restrict the advance was purely for motives , rather than for the benefit of nations which were under the eye of the communist empire ( Kagan himself acknowledges the fact when he says , `` With the check of the power removed , the United States was to intervene practically whenever and wherever it chose ... '' ( pg26 ) ) . Second , when Kagan acknowledges that Europe which has a `` $ 9 trillion `` economy is in a position to support its welfare programs along with spending ; attributing the fact that Europe spends more on welfare , as he calls them `` free-riders '' , results in a faulty analysis . When I had mentioned earlier that Kagan chose to omit and ignore facts , the example of the Balkans , which the author has cited times in his book would seem most . Kosovo is one of the issues he discusses to bring US benevolence and incapacity . `` involvement in Kosovo or Bosnia was not based on calculations of a ` interest ' ... While Americans had a interest in stopping genocide and cleansing , ... the US had no ` interest ' at stake in the Balkans '' ( pg.50 ) , this is how Kagan sees it . Indeed stopping genocide was a concern , but was it the concern ? While Milosevic had very agreed to station NATO troops in Kosovo to stop the conflicts , none seem to have been in his offer ; they rather wanted access and control to all of Yugoslavia . The Rambouillet Accord , to which the Contact Group added an Appendix B on the day of the conference held at Paris , one must note was the reason for rejecting NATO troops , as it demanded Yugoslavia to surrender its autonomy and sovereignty . Yet , he does not mention of Milosevic agreeing to station NATO troops in Kosovo ( http : *5 ) . Some thing missing from Kagan 's book are the words `` Latin America '' and `` Africa '' . As seen above , Kagan believes America was spending its money protecting Europe and Europe alone from all the threats around the world , before and after the Cold War . But what baffles me to quite an extent is that not once does Kagan mention about any intervention in Latin America ( official or not ) , Africa or the Far East for that matter . Those who are well of the world around them , will be of America 's support for dictators and corrupt regimes throughout Latin America and the far East , Indonesia for example , which were for purposes alone or is it that the author is implying that the and countries were a threat to Europe , hence the interventions and no mention of them ? ( A timeline by Steven Kangas can be found on sites *6 , 7 , 8 ) There is one ` defect ' , as I put it , which undermines the argument of this book . Kagan 's vision approach , which refers to the word ` power ' only in terms of strength and capabilities , ultimately results in a dichotomy , which is the stumbling stone for his thesis . Kagan believes the world and in , Europe , is left with two options , that either they follow the US or be a audience . The reason he reaches this conclusion as I previously put it , is to his convergent view . `` Rather than viewing the US as a Gulliver tied down by threads '' , says Kagan , `` leaders should realize that they are hardly constrained at all , that Europe is not really of constraining the US '' . He reinforces this claim throughout his book ( see 33 , , 59 , 62 , etc ) . The author 's ignorance about hard-hitting , highly and facts has rendered blows to the validity of his claims . Kagan has committed errors here , by ignoring Europe 's strength , not but and indeed . With a population of 456,953,258 ( the CIA Fact Book *9 ) and still growing , the EU , leave aside Europe , can not be simply or brushed aside as a competitor or a culture . Europe is economically enough to trouble the US as and when it wants to , the problems over the genetically meat , banana dispute , steel industry debacle , Airbus-Boeing clash and , have all proved that Europe 's strength is much of a concern for the US . While I must point out a rank deletion , I believe this is ` the ' factor which is for arguing against all of Kagan 's thesis and arguments , and that is the Economy . Not once has he mentioned the deteriorating state of economy ( 2001 ) , even though problems did exist when he wrote this book . He seems to be blissfully and persists that America can sustain its exorbitant defense spending , `` ... the US can sustain its spending levels and its dominance far into the future '' . Strangely , the growing inflation rate , rising unemployment , stagflation , trends the economy was showing of heading towards a recession , were I believe dismissed as myths by the author ( for statistics see - www.bbcnews.com ; http : //wsws.org *10 , 11 ) . Also , Kagan 's solution suggest that , `` The answer is that Europe should ... . and build up its , even if only marginally '' , leaves me with a conundrum . Is Kagan implicating that Europe has no military at all or is it that he wants to begin a arms race , this time Cold War II ? Kagan must understand he is writing this book for publics and not simply those , whose ideologies are in tandem with his . Hence , I doubt most would disagree that the world should get into an arms race here , as we all know , there is no stopping to this if it once starts . While I have already discussed the effects of trade and economics ( which Kagan ignores ) on the relation , there is something I must point out before I end this review . Kagan , rather conveniently digresses of the topic , which is relationships , to justifying US hegemony in a fashion . While Americans themselves would probably not agree with Kagan 's ideology ( as the opinion and plummets - see polls from news sources *12 ) , leave Europeans or rest of the world , Kagan writes almost 15 pages to justify it . This was a rather conclusion to his book , where he thinks the solution to the ever widening divide is `` Adjusting to Hegemony '' . When Kagan says how ( statistics seem to abandon him ) Americans believe that by advancing their interest , they advance the interest of humanity , he sounds exuberantly and to drive the point home , he quotes Benjamin Franklin as saying - `` America 's cause is the cause of all mankind '' and again I must bring to the author 's notice , the recipient of these remarks is an audience , which is diverse , has its culture and heritage , beliefs and ideologies and has no reason to believe why their culture or beliefs are to any . An author of his stature must realize that it is relationships and not a grade bully that is being discussed . While he seems to take pride in saying that America has a `` go it alone '' attitude ( pg.39 , 99 ) , it does not abide by the UN Security Council ( pg.40 , 99 ) , takes action unilaterally of laws ( pg.45 , 61 , 99 ) , is justified in adopting ` standards ' ( pg.62 , 99 ) , he fails to fathom the gravity of the day ( or rather the day when he wrote this book ) situation and the growing unpopularity of policy around the world . While he sees Europe as an obstacle in the path of America 's goals , a observer would be than justified in pointing out that may be it is the US that hinders progress and efforts of the EU to establish a world which respects laws , rights , opinion and of all - peace . He fails to give an impartial , if not a solution to rid the world of this wedge as he weakly concludes his essay by saying , `` ... a understanding can still go a way '' . While have nothing but words of praise , as a one line summary by Francis Fukuyama calls it - `` '' ( a co-architect and signatory of the Rebuilding America 's Defense Project ) and according to Dr. Henry Kissinger , [ against whom charges of violations have been levied , who ironically , Kagan terms as a `` realist '' . See - http : //en.wikipedia.org ( for cases ) *13 ; http : //www.thenation.com ( for list of crimes ) *14 ] the book is a `` treatise '' which would `` shape the ( US-Europe relation ) discussion for years to come '' ; I do not particularly endorse it it . As I have already put forth data to show why the book lacks a argument , sane reasoning or evidence , though its lucid prose , comprehension and its articulate linking makes it a read , it barely digs into the problem or the solution , apart from scratching the surface , ` the surface ' . Indeed the book did create waves in the arena , which was probably to its timing , but I cast doubts on the claims that it would be `` discussed for years to come '' . *1 - http : //www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf *2 - http : //www.climnet.org/news/march2001.html *3 - http : //news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1383385.stm *4 - http : //212.58.226.30/1/hi/business/2052405.stm *5 - http : *6 - http : //www.atrocities.net/ *7 - home.att.net/~Resurgence/CIAtimeline.html *8 - www.serendipity.li/cia/cia_time.htm *9 - http : //www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ee.html *10 - http : *11 - http : //news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1263211.stm *12 - http : //www.michaelmoore.com/words/index.php *13 - http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger *14 - http : //www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames ? bid=3 pid=17\", \"Fast and Loose I suppose every author in this genre comes to the table with an agenda .

As someone very in exploration ( especially in the subways ) I wanted to check this book out upon hearing of it . After reading of these Amazon reviews though , I opted out of a purchase , and took it out of my Bronx library instead . Thank goodness as I only wasted time , and not any money . This book is a sham . It is obviously mostly fiction . And it 's fiction at that . The book is divided into chapters , each chapter a `` adventure . '' I read the subway one first , where the `` explorers '' take the 6 train around the loop at the end of the line , to see the City Hall Station , which opened in 1904 ( NYC 's station ) and closed in 1948 . The station is located on the loop of the 6 train , that makes the southbound trains go back up north after the stop , Brooklyn Bridge . First of all , anyone can go on this `` adventure . '' Just stay on the train at the stop , Brooklyn Bridge , and that 's it . Despite the author 's attempt to make this sound , no conductors walk through the train to see if anyone is on ( like they really care ) , just sit down . The author created some `` tourists '' that inadvertantly stayed on the 6 after the stop , and the author even tries to create some mystery by saying `` are we on the train ? '' Well , unless all those `` 6 '' signs that are lit all over the train are to read , then you probably got on the correct train . The author also fails to mention that the MTA used to give tours all the time through this station ( and others like the 18th street on the 6 and ) but stopped after 9-11 . This chapter was a joke . I started reading the chapters , and saw they were no . I then started to breeze through the book . One thing that is very - no photographs of the adventures are in the book at all . This , despite the fact that on page 67 the author states , `` Josh takes out his camera and snaps away at every pipe and puddle ... '' But no photos of their `` adventures '' are in the book . Why ? Because it 's fiction . There are photos of what they are supposed to be exploring , , that 's . There 's even one pic of one of these clowns hopping some fence somewhere , ooo . Buit no pics of the `` adventures . '' I guess `` Josh '' lost all those pictures when he went to CVS to have them developed . The thing is , you can save yourself a lot of time by just going and viewing pictures of these things for yourself . Especially the City Hall station , there are tons of pictures of it from the people that were in there during the tours .

And how about the Inquisition , where Church authorities sanctioned torture against `` heretics ? '' Well , Crocker concedes that torturing someone might stray a bit from Christ 's message of tolerance ... but hey , they threatened the authority of the Catholic church , so they got what they deserved . Uh , yeah , amen brother . These considerations aside , the book is n't even well researched , which immediately destroys its credibility with me . For example from the crusade , Crocker states that the armies of the heretics numbered over 100,000 , yet with only a thousand men , the Pope was to defeat them , as they were filled with the `` glory of god '' or something like that . Curiously , in his footnotes he cites nothing to back this claim up . Maybe because it is n't .

And like of my book group , I was fairly disappointed by this novel from him . Originally published in Turkey in 1985 , the story is prefaced by an introduction in which one Faruk Darvinoglu purports to have discovered the manuscript in a archive . He then goes on to explain that parts of the story can be historically corroborated , but much of it ca n't . This should immediately alert the reader not to take everything in the book as it comes . Even more so if the reader knows that Darvinoglu is the protagonist of Pamuk 's book The House of Silence . tricks immediately bring to mind the works of Calvino , Borges , and their ilk . The plot is very : in the , a gentleman is captured by raiders and sold into slavery to an aspiring scholar who happens to look just like him . The two men then spend the decades cloistered together , engaged in investigations of astronomy , biology , engineering , and so on . These bring them to the attention of the Sultan ( based on Mehmet IV ) , whose patronage waxes and wanes , culminating in a attempt to construct a war machine . Along the way , their relationship swings back and forth , and is interrupted by an outbreak of the plague , whose outcome they are tasked with predicting . The book concludes with a section which will challenge the reader 's assumptions and calls into question everything that comes before it . Namely , are there two characters or are they just manifestations of two aspects of a person ? This all unfolds at a pace , and the two `` characters '' are ciphers . Their clashing of wills and ideas take up page after page , but the reader is always told about the conflict rather than shown it , and this makes for disengaging reading . Pamuk seems much less in storytelling or characters than in themes as the nature of identity , the collision of cultures , and the very nature of reality . But none of these are addressed in a way that is particularly or . The tension between East and West is handled in a fairly manner , as the master is obsessed with advances in science and technology , while the Sultan has a appetite for tales and soothsayers . This all comes across as a rather satire of the fluidity of character . In the end , this is not a particularly introduction to writer whom have compared to Eco , Calvino , Borges , Kafka , and Kundera . However , readers who enjoy highly works about self-identity with narrators may find this a satisfying read\", \"Waste of time Sorry , but I found this book a waste of time .

Instead she befriends even more people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I could n't have cared what happened to her anyway ! After reading it ( book on tape ) I felt I had totally wasted my time . What a disappointment\", \"From Christianity ... To 'Churchianity' The author comes off as a whining , camper about having to grow up in what he considers a 'stifling ' church environment ; further apalled by the Church Founder 's belief , in that it ( the Worlwide Church Of God ) was God 's True Church through the ages , right on up to the 'end time ' . Feazell spends a amount of time giving his opinions on Herbert W. Armstrong , the Church 's teachings , and a trashing and somewhat of a misreprentation of the denomination as a whole , labeling it a 'cult ' ... and further damning its Pastor General as a `` '' , despite the Church 's works , publishing , Colleges and outreach for world peace over the seven decades under the leadership of H.W . Armstrong . Since Armstrong 's death in 1986 , Feazell and his cohort Joseph Tkach Jr. seem to be having a field day jumping up and down on his remains , and writing books on how it feels to be loosed from having to keep the Holy Days , , commandments ( which , in his estimation are now the suggestions ' ) and lifestyle of this Day Church Of God denomination . Mr. Feazell apparently does not speak for all the Church membership , as over 100,000 members left and formed Church Of God conferences throughout the United States ... and continuing the legacy and apostolic , Christian system of worship restored by Herbert W.

John Katzenbach is an author and I had previously read and enjoyed another of his novels ( The Analyst ) , so I was surprised at how The Shadow Man was . The premise of the plot is that four very people , survivors of the Holecaust , believe they have seen the `` Shadow Man '' . The Shadow Man was a Jew who joined forces with the Nazis to find Jews that were hiding to avoid doom in concentration camps . These four people feared the Shadow Man than anything . When one of them is killed , a police detective named Simon Winter looks into who the Shadow Man is . Meanwhile , the Miami police are also investigating the death of the woman and have gangster as a suspect . Eventually , Winter and the police and the District Attourney join to hunt the Shadow Man , a man of evil . As the book villian , it was to fear a villian who was a killer 50 years ago but was now in his 70s . Also , this book barely touches on WWII , yet purports at times to be a about WWII . I 've read a lot of WWII novels , and this book would have been if it had been set in the 60s . But setting it day with citizens and the characters was n't too . It was n't primarily because I wondered where had the Shadow Man been all these years ? Why was he starting to kill now ? The Shadow Man had no motivation to kill . Finally , I realized I did n't like this book when I was skipping paragraphs at a time during the 20 pages . The book was like this with each character prone to long rambling thoughts that really added nothing to the story . If you take away the WWII angle , this novel is . The WWII angle adds some excitement , but there are probably thousands of books out there that relate the horror of WWII than this one does . The review from Publishers Weekly printed above summarizes my thoughts and deserves to be repeated ...

A number of Narby 's ideas regarding DNA and Shamanism are intriguing enough but he has apparently decided that all Shamanism is based on Molecular Biology , while he freely admits that he is being very reductionist on this point , I still see problems with his view that Shamanism is based on Molecular Biology at heart . His argument mostly surrounds the symbol of the Serpent/Dragon which is in mythologies often with connections to water and associations with twins . He decides that this is in actually a representation of DNA as viewed by Shamans and believes that all serpents in mythology and visions are actually DNA . Since DNA emits photons and this has been shown to possibly play a part in cell communication ( along with the communication ) Narby believes that in trances the shaman becomes to see the light emitted by DNA ( which often show up as snakes ) and the shaman communicates with the bits of DNA ( which is ) and the linked network of DNA based life . As justification for this argument he points out that some groups hold that spirits are beings of pure light , to him this is almost literally as the spirits are actually DNA and communicate through as `` spirits '' . From there he goes on to say that all ladders , staircases , and ropes in quests are representations of DNA and when the shaman uses them he is travelling along DNA and similarly when the shaman goes to the underworld he is sinking down to the world of Molecular Biology ( although since one can apparently work with and see DNA in the world one must ask why one would need to shrink down ) . While these views might make for some discussion about some practices , Narby seems to have ignored the aspects of visions and quests and any elements than snakes or things that just happen to be and . Given Narby 's view of spirits as DNA one must ask what helpers/allies are ? Is someone 's guides DNA in some bacteria on my hand ? Will I kill Yahweh by washing my hands with soap ( maybe that 's why Jesus decided that washing one 's hands was ! ) ? A lot of his proof is like the proof of Erich von D�niken except that where D�niken saw aliens and spacecraft , Narby sees DNA and Molecules . Take for example this D�niken-esque proof from the book : '' The second was a rock painting of the Rainbow Snake . I looked at it more closely and saw two things : All around the serpent there were sorts of chromosomes , in their `` U '' shape , and underneath it there was a kind of ladder ! '' ( p. 79 ) By Chapter 10 , entitled Biology 's Blind Spot , Narby has decided that Evolution is and all of Science must be toppled . This bit seems to have come out of nowhere like someone spliced a Design rant into a book where it did n't belong and as with all Pro-ID and Creationist literature we get the faulty attacks again and again . Attacks as Evolution being based on a argument because the most species survive to spread their genes and therefore are . Yes , that is the definition of fitness , and sometimes the basis of things start as tautologies as the Theory of Gravity but like Gravity Natural Selection and evolution is and by looking at it 's power . Population genetics and mathematics shows clearly that selection is very and has so far not been falsified . Similarly , we can also look at the fossil record in strata for evidence of change over time . After that attack Narby then attacks the Central Dogma ( Which is how transcription of DNA to proteins works ) by misinterpreting what Francis Crick meant . Crick never meant the word Dogma in Central Dogma to be taken in the sense it is used in religion instead he meant it as a joke name for a hypothesis that he had at the time evidence for . Narby misinterprets Crick 's joke to argue that evolution is apparently Faith based , since this argument has no basis in reality it falls immediately . He then argues that ants and animals are fully because they do amazing things that seem to require forethought and they tap into DNA like shamans to do things . animals are and may have consciousness but ants are pretty . One is reminded of Edward Selous and others ' ideas about thought-transference to explain how flocks of birds move and how ants and termites build hives , as it turns out birds flocking behaviour operates on rules ( clustering , maintaining speed , and distance ) and so are Ant Nesting behaviours . One proof of this is to put food just out of the reach of ants , and some dirt underneath , while they understand how to move earth and tunnel they will never purposely move earth to build ramps , bridges , or tunnels to reach a goal . The birds who flew in flocks and the ancestors of ants who had developed nesting behaviour managed to survive and so these behaviours somehow became instincts and persisted . Now Narby makes the extremely argument that life is too complicated to be determined by chance alone , and he is on this matter . Too there is than chance guiding evolution , we also have Natural Selection guiding the process , to quote Richard Dawkins : `` results from the survival of randomly varying replicators . '' The combinations which work and and are kept in the population . Narby argues `` How can a telephone directory of information emerge from random processes ? '' ( P. 142 ) to answer this I wish to quote a bit of Michael Shermer 's 25 Creationists ' Arguments and 25 Evolutionists ' Answers which nicely illustrates how selection can produce Shakespeare 's Hamlet quickly from letters : '' Natural selection is not `` random '' nor does it operate by `` chance . '' selection preserves the gains and eradicates the mistakes . The eye evolved from a , cell into the eye of today through hundreds if not thousands of steps , of which still exist in nature . In order for the monkey to type the 13 letters of Hamlet 's soliloquy by chance , it would take 26 to the power of 13 number of trials for success . This is 16 times as as the number of seconds that have elapsed in the lifetime of the system . But if each letter is preserved and each letter eradicated , the process operates much faster . How ? Richard Hardison constructed a computer program in which letters were `` selected '' for or against , and it took an average of only 335.2 trials to produce the sequence of letters TOBEORNOTTOBE . This takes the computer than 90 seconds . The play can be done in about 4.5 days ! '' Narby also tries to argue that gaps in the fossil record as in evolution and places where there are or no forms indicate that evolution has not occurred . This however just means that in this instance there are gaps in the fossil record because the fossils have not been found yet . Narby also points to the seemingly appearance of species in the fossil record as an argument against evolution . Apparently Narby has never heard of Punctuated Equilibrium . Narby stunningly also tries to argue that because portions of DNA is over species that this somehow indicates design , unfortunately for Narby a lot of these sequences of DNA code for the processes of life . A human who could n't cope with oxygen or a fox which could not metabolize energy would not long in this world . The fact that these sequences are is actually a point for evolution because the processes have been preserved and we even see structures in animals even when it is not or as digits in the fins of dolphins or the appendix in humans . Finally , we come back circle to his argument about Natural Selection being a form of logic and he ties to paint Evolution as ( No , we can test it 's predictions in fields as Genetics and Palaeontology ) and being denounce by an increasing number of scientists ( not at all ) . All in all while Narby has some nuggets of information and ideas in The Cosmic Serpent he ultimately seems to squander these ideas by jumping around in directions and to strange conclusions based on very evidence\", \"Too Out of Touch Herself She wastes the chapters , and my time , going to extremes with consultants that only someone who does n't deserve to be hired would use .

Sontag 's analysis of the supposed ruination of the works of Kafka by interpretation demonstrates that not only is she among this crowd , she has clearly reached and of heights . Second , Sontag ignores the fact that works of art in languages can not be understood in translation without the help of interpretation and criticism that demonstrates the extent to which aspects of a culture are imbedded in the language . This could n't possibly be than in poetry . Weinberger 's quot ; Nineteen Ways of Looking at Wang Wei quot ; , which adroitly considers the subject , had n't been released when Sontag published this essay but it probably would n't have made a difference .

But Gray 's generalizations , dumbing down of issues and sharing his sex life with his wife Bonnie were mostly , and I suspect that the passages I found funny were involuntarily so . Although I 'm the to admit that women love compliments , Gray 's suggestions , as displayed in 10-lists of things to say ( and , occasionally , what not to say ) were a tidbit too ( ever wonder how combinations you can play with the phrase `` your breasts are '' ?

Almost as enlightening was the tip on how , while getting to the part , the man should pull the woman 's panties `` up her crack '' ( a.k.a . give her a plain wedgie -- no joke ) . And , do n't miss the one where the Mongolian woman pulls a flag at mast when she 's in the mood and at half when she 's not ( or maybe it was colors , I could n't read clearly through my tears -- no offense to the people ! ) .

Margaret Mitchell has nothing to fear from this `` parody '' , which is really a not so , in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal , that epitome of Scarlett O'Hara and the Melanie Wilkes.As if Rhett would ever give any woman a thought-he was obsessed with Scarlett.That 's why he turned to women like Belle Watling.And to imagine Mammy killing the male babies , when she had been devoted to Ellen O'Hara from Ellen 's childhood.Thank goodness this book is n't a pimple on the fanny of the GWTW , because what it is a a travesty-and not even a or engaging one at that.GWTW will still be read and loved for all time , like the it is , when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.I did n't even pay that , thank woman gave it to me , and I read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.I 'd give it a star if there was a and laughable-try again , Ms Randall , and try to get over the jealousy of Scarlett and Co.

Gould rambles on and on , attacking giants of science like Samuel Morton and Francis Galton , and never putting up any conclusions of his . Gould presents fabricated objections to research and selectively studies that make a correlation between intelligence and brain and size as well as differences in brain size between the population groups and correlations between brain size and class . Gould only ridicules the most claims of racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven . For anyone who has no knowledge of biology , this book will give them a very view of the science . Stephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist ; biology is an field for him , and it would be best if he , as well as all crypto-Marxists who wish to blend science and politics , stay out of it', \"Sophie 's Choice Gone Wrong This is the story of Stingo , a 22 y/o aspiring writer in NYC in 1947 who meets a pair of lovers , Sophie and Nathan , at his boarding house and is drawn into their relationship , falling in love with both and witnessing their self-destruction . Nathan is a mentally deranged and genius . Sophie is a survivor of Auschwitz . Her story unfolds as she confides to Nathan the truths of her unwillingness to join the resistance , her capture over a infraction and her choice when she arrives in the camp -- she must decide which of her children will live and which will be sent immediately to the gas chamber . While Nathan and Sophie are both , characters with obstacles , Stingo , the narrator , is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his to . Despite his thirty or so years of perspective on the events of '47 which he is relating , he seems to possess or no wisdom about them , no viewpoints about his life or his friends ' tragedies , and his actions and attitudes at the age of 22 are so and as to be almost . The novel is far too long -- it could be nearly cut in half and only benefit . The style is foolishly , far , especially in the half . And in the end while the structure of narrator/observer seems like a choice in the abstract , the narrator and his lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of Nathan and Sophie . In the end , the narrator never even approaches the question in my mind : why did Sophie so quickly choose Eva to die rather than Jan ? A lack of understanding of what would happen to the girl ? A blind panic ? A preference for her son , the sort of preference parents may harbor that is never because we are never asked to choose ? It is this having chosen which seems than the tragedies to have really destroyed Sophie , and yet it 's glossed over in the . In fact , it 's followed by Sophie and Stingo having an night of 'fu -- -ng ' as the novel would put it . Really ? Almost to believe Sophie could get it together to have peremptory sex after her drinking and her revelations . She uses sex to escape with her lover Nathan , but it 's to imagine this sexcapade Stingo relates . Could it be that Styron only knows how to connect people through sex ? How this could be considered one of the novels of all time is a mystery to me .

The plot is and and is littered with so name-dropping that sometimes it 's to follow . The characters are taken straight from Stereotype 101 and are so badly written that they 're to relate to . The writing is and lumbers along awkwardly , lacking , wit , or interest . Especially irritating is Grazer 's insistence on using Gracie 's name as much as .

More or less her personality issues - the fact that Gracie had too personality . Gracie said and did pretty what Gracie pleased , in the beginning .

As a , chef and baker , I am also an avid baking and cookbook collector . After seeing that this book won and the James Beard and the 'IACP Cookbook of the Year ' awards -both prominently displayed on the cover of this book- and after reading the 'too to be true'-reviews on Amazon -some reviewers sound so and in trance as if Peter Reinhart is the Jesus Christ of Bread- I finally decided to buy this book . What a dissappointment ! For all those blindly following Reinhart as he were the Saviour of True Bread , wake up ! Reinhart 's book is simply flawed . Compared to books , it 's even a book . But one that is luxuriously packaged . A lot of air . And it 's not because of the info and bread knowledge in it , but because of the super luxuriously editing . This is a book for book enthousiasts , not for bakers , or home . I see baking and cookbooks mainly as working tools , as information and inspiration . Not as eye candy . If you want pictures , buy an art book . A book on baking bread with these awards behind it , should give you tons of info about ingredients and techniques , insights , an appetite for baking , info , the and tested developments in technique ... What you get here is a fluffed up egotrip . 47 formulas and bread info packaged into a shining $ publishing hype . Do n't get me : this is a , book . But one you do n't use in the kitchen , and certainly do n't smudge with butter but put on the coffee table in the living room to impress guests and have polite conversations about . But as a source of information or enlightening up to date bread knowledge , giving pointers about using ingredients combined with bread baking techniques , as a working tool sweating near the oven at home or at a bakery , compared to books , this book fails miserably . But it has a lay out . Jeff Hamelmans 'Bread , a Book of Techniques ' and Rose Beranbaums 'Bread Bible ' give the readers much more info and insight into baking . They talk more about the 'bread ' . And not about themselves like Peter Reinhart clearly relishes . Mr Reinhart clearly sees himself as so and interesting a person that we read in this book about his wife and their sightseeing in Paris . How about the bread info , the kneading , rising , baking , and techniques info ? I honestly prefer bakers who pass on their baking knowledge clearly without having to read at which hotel room they stayedin . Bakers with ego 's that think that readers of a Bread Baking book are more in the shopping experiences of the wife during ' a trip ' to bakers on which she accompanied him , than in another bread formula 's , should work in shobizz , not in a bakery or a school . Big ego 's with more talk than substance galore in the food industry . Reinart is , judging by this book , sadly also one of them . I do n't see in a 1000 years Rose Beranbaum in one of her books rambling on about her husbands color of ties or Jeff Hamelman writing in a book about the time he spent with his wife in Paris . Mr.Reinhart : your readers forked out $ for bread info , not your travel experiences . As you as a teachers no doubts sometimes say to a pupil : Stay with the subject ! And the subject of this book , for which I paid is and Baking . If we want to know about your life , we 'll read an interview in People , if they find you enough . Peter Reinharts 'The Bread Baker 's Apprentice ' as a Book ' is simply a marketing creation . Smartly edited , but way too on substance . There is not information on bread . : there is not info at all ! In for $ , you get exactly 47 formulas on 307 pages of which 2 color photo pages are simply ads for books by Ten Speed Press , the editor or this book . Compared to Beranbaums 640 pages , Hamelmans 400 plus pages , that is a difference for a price . With Reinharts book , you get a lot of shining surface that in Bread books is filled with info . As a buyer of this book , you also pay for page and color pictures that are filler . See 3 , 6 , 26 ... And why is the model Fumie on the cover of a book and not Reinhart himself or even ... bread alone ? With Reinharts book they will no doubt put Kate Moss in an apron and a bakers vest . Package the air enough and the readers will swallow it and fork out the $ . Never mind the content . Let 's talk a bit about the formula 's . That should be an part of a baking book , right ? And they should be and tuned , right ? Sadly to say : nothing or here . Some are n't even tuned . And baking is all about tuning . , almost all the formula 's can be found in books . And , insulting for a buyer of this book , a lot of the 47 formulas ( Reinhart uses this word because 'recipe ' propably does n't fit into the marketing of this baking book ) in this book are rehashed or directly derived from Reinharts book 'Crust and Crumb ' . Clever marketing and ba-da-bing ! By the way , 'Crust and Crumb ' has been reedited in 2006 . At a price , I admit . So if you want your dose of Reinhart at a price without the pomp , sc�nes of a marriage , without Peter Reinharts comment on the Eiffel tower so to speak ... buy 'Crust and Crumb ' and leave this luxuriously edited egotrip on the shelves . But before I buy I would also first flip through Beranbaums and Hamelmans bread books in the bookshop or in the Amazon shop . As for this book , you should ask yourself : 'Do I want a bread book or a book ? ' . Taking in consideration all the egostroking in this book and in reviews , as a baking book for the world market , this book is almost . The accepted working standard in baking is weight . Like it or not , but that 's a fact . You weigh your ingredients carefully by grams , kilo 's etc . Reinhart visited bakers Poilane and Gosselin , clearly admires them and aspires to reach their level of baking . I do n't think that Poilane measures in cups and ounces ! But even then , let Reinhart measure in cups for the home market . But then have the decency to add the equivalent in the formula 's itself for the rest of the world . This guy goes on and on about his wish to bake inspired bread like ciabatta , fougasse ... About a Worldwide Bread Revolution ! And then he refuses to use the most tool to make these breads : the language , the weight system . Rose Beranbaum places the to the cups/ounces . It 's a as that . Bread is a world food , so use the world standard for baking . If not , market your book mainly to the USA market and be honest and about that . And do n't give us that inflated air about a Worldwide Bread Revolution without using the worldwide accepted working standard , the wieght system ! This flaw makes the book almost for bakers outside the USA . The Worldwide Bread Revolution wo n't be for if we have to use this book worldwide ! point : Reinhart advocates yeast over pressed yeast . Every baker worth his salt ( or yeast ) will tell you that yeast gives a far taste , volume and texture . Yeast is a organism . As yeast ' it has been dried and put on the shelves for God knows how . It 's like you force a just woken up coma-patient , that has been for months , years ... to run a marathon . Fresh , pressed yeast is still and its taste and texture are a world of difference compared to 'instant ' ( aka dried ) yeast . Try the difference between yeast and yeast for taste and texture and fully developed rising at home , and judge for yourself . To place yeast on the level as yeast is for someone like Reinhart who spends days on his pre ferments ! For back up , you can always read the recently translated book of world renowed food scientist Herve This Gastronomy , Exploring the Science of Flavor ' ( Columbia University Press 2006 ) . And it gets . Reinhart frequently uses shortening instead of butter or oil in his breads . If Poilane hears this , he 'll drop ! Every baker knows that even a amount of butter gives a much taste and texture than shortening . Shortening produces a taste and a slimy , mouthfeel . Not to talk about health . shortening is of trans fats which are much more than butter fat . Read Harvard 's nutrition professor Walter Willets book : 'Eat , Drink and be Healthy ' ( Press 2001 ) . New York has already picked this info up . food writer and teacher Reinhart has n't or does n't care . For instance , Reinhart proudly declares -not as a joke- that in bread you can use shortening instead of oil . In Bread ! Come on , let 's be . And this guy teaches at the Culinary Institute of America ! It 's like he is advocating spam to put on the BBQ instead of beef ! If that is the standard of baking that Reinhart uses , he 'll have to wait a time to reach the standards of a Poilane . Then there is Reinharts Hygi�ne Problem . There is an standard for hygiene in food called the Hazzard Analysis of Critical Control Points ( HACCP ) . Reinhart as a tutor and teacher must no doubt know the HACCP by heart . The thing in hygiene that an apprentice baker learns , is that before even touching ingredients , he must remove all the rings on his fingers . Because the place underneath a wedding band for instance , is the place where the filth gathers and bacteria feast . And kneading dough with all that filth underneath a wedding band that you keep on , is not only very for the health of customers , it is simply not done for a baker . I like my bread without filth baked in , thank you very much ! In the school where I earned my diplome in baking , if a student had a ring on during class , he had to leave the class immediately and he lost points for his exam . Yet we see teacher and Bread Book Author Reinhart kneading dough WITH HIS WEDDING BAND ON ! See 36-37 , 82-83 , 255 , 245 ... in a ' baking book . And all the more in an book that won the James Beard and IACP awards ! Has anyone of the juries of the James Beard Foundation and the IACP , any knowledge of food hygiene ? Has nobody seen this sin against food hygi�ne in a so Bread Book ' ? One thing , for a book that pretends to be world class , there is no word about bread . Not one formula . And this while and people are to gluten ( protein in flour ) . To end on a note , one thing I found in this coffee table book , was his 55 pages with the 12 stages of bread . But , reviewers , you can find all this info and , and explained clearly , and to the point , in Hamelmans 'Bread ' and Beranbaums 'Bread Bible ' . And it does n't take 55 pages of quality shining paper . Peter , take out all the space , learn to write clearly and to the point , and you can say the thing in 20 pages . Which leaves you 35 pages for formula 's for example . But if you have n't any formula 's left or are preparing a book , then , yes , by all means stretch the 12 stages of bread to 55 scarcely printed pages instead of 20 . Why make it if you can make it seem , impress your not so readers and in doing so stroking your ego ? So despite all the hoopla , hyped reviews , praise and awards , this is simply a too , show off-book . It 's like the tale of King with no Clothes on ' . Somebody has to yell : 'Hey , wait a minute !

As a science fiction film , the Annie Hall is a disappointment . Whatever merits these movies might have , there are definitely areas that they are lacking . brings me to The Rough Guide to Cult Movies : as a reference book , it is highly . What 's is that Annie Hall fails as sci-fi because it does n't try to be that genre ; The Rough Guide fails at the very it aspires to . Which is too , because it is often an read . The failure starts at the beginning of the book with a definition of cult movies that is so as to be . We then a series of chapters representing `` genres '' , some of which are ( science fiction , westerns , horror ) , some of which are ( Animals , Food , Nuns ) and some of which are not even genres ( dubbed , , ) . After this , we get topics that are thrown in without rhyme or reason , as a list of movie grosses followed by movie trivia . The movie descriptions are often , although there are errors ( as misstating Geoffrey Rush 's role in Pirates of the Caribbean ) , even omissions ( every reader will find his ; one example is that Unforgiven is missing from Westerns ) and plenty of movies that are really miscategorized but seem only placed in a genre to fill it out . What saves this book is , even though it fails as a reference book , it is nonetheless . I am therefore giving this two stars instead of one . It 's a rather book , especially if you want to learn about movies , but if you do pick it up , it is probably the most book that you 're ever to read .\", \"hatred with sounding documentation Another farce to feed hatred with sounding documentation ...

At the time the brother contends with guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence . Not only does he deal with his family , but his brothers friend , a sexy law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for . And that 's only the start of the plot . Its really pretty , it descends into pretensions and resolutions . The characters are so that you are left with notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their ways . Baldacci is along with James Patterson and Dean Koontz one of America 's authors .

The book starts in 1936 , although people know that the march to war really began with the seizure of Manchuria in 1932 . The author continually repeats the refrain that `` Americans do n't understand the mentality and culture '' , and it was this `` misunderstanding '' that led to the war . It is that Toland defines the term `` gekokujo '' as being some sort of `` insubordination '' that led to the Kwantung Army to feel it could move , presumably without orders from Tokyo , into Manchuria . However , Toland does not explain how this could happen . There is description of the power structure in Japan , we do know that there was some attempt to create democracy , but there were also the oligarchs who had power , plus the hierarchy . Somehow , the took control in the 1930 's , but Toland does n't really say how . He describes in detail the `` 2/26 '' Uprising of officers in 1936 , and how they were to kill without compunction , and how they were , yet we are then told that they OPPOSED expansion into China , and that the repression of this coup attempt would lead to an expanded war in China . I must say I do n't understand this at all ... Toland potrays them as fanatics , yet they seem to be `` the guys '' . Were n't those who supported expansion into China also fanatics ? This is left totally . Toland then goes on to describe the `` Incident at the Marco Polo Bridge '' in 1937 near Peking ( Beijing ) which led to the invasion of China . Toland says the government in Tokyo , again , had nothing to do with it , in fact both the Chinese and commanders on the spot tried to calm things down , but some `` hotheads '' ( possibly Chinese Communists ) kept inflaming the situation . Somehow ( without Toland telling us how ) , a decision is made by someone ( not necessarily the `` '' Prime Minister Prince Konoye ) to mount a invasion of China . An impression is left by Toland that the Chinese , , the Koumintang government of Chiang Kai-shek was and . All I know is that that Marco Polo Bridge is within China , and it is that the Chinese would resent the presence there . After this , we move on to the atrocities of the `` Rape of Nanking '' , which again , according to Toland , `` somehow '' happens , ( Toland does admit that there were atrocities and between 200,000 and 300,000 Chinese were butchered by their `` brother Asians '' who claimed to be liberating them ( ? ) ) . Toland says the commander at Nanking did not order any behavior , nor again , did the government in Tokyo . How then do thousands of supposedly disciplined troops suddenly get it into their heads to do things ? Toland does n't give us a clue , than his statement that `` westerners do n't understand the '' . Toland also , in a way , tries to claim that opposition to expansion into China was `` '' because of Colonialism in East Asia ( US in the Philippines ; Britain in Hong Kong , Malaya , Burma , India ; Dutch in East Indies ; French in Indochina ) , however , by the 1930 's the US had already agreed to give the Philippines independence and the were beginning to wind down the Raj in India was setting up an government , so it was that Colonialism was already on its way out before the war .

While I agree that students must learn to differentiate one property/theorem/rule/postulate from another , it does n't make sense that , instead of some , diagrams are .

I guess this may be to romance readers who do not know or core Beverly fans\", \"poetry in Riis ' How he oher half Lives How the Half Lives was written over a century ago as an ' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of New York City . The author speaks with a crusader 's zeal and with so detail that the reader can visualize these tenements , these streets , and these people as if they were living today . This is a and moving portrayal of the lives of the men , the women and the children that inhabit these neighborhoods of New York City in the 1800s . He so graphically describes the filth , the sunless and airless rooms , the crowding , and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart . Riis has a concern for the situation and understands these people 's plight . His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery . He , for the part , blames the landlords for these conditions : `` How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man . '' ( p. 266 ) . He laments that the tenement is three quarters for the misery of the . Then , after his discourse , he offers three concrete cures for these conditions , something that authors forget when they are enlightening readers . Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says , `` If this book shall have borne ever so a hand in garnering a harvest of justice , it has served its purpose . '' The author apparently succeeded with his purpose , because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us : `` This book helped bring about revisions in the housing codes of the U. S . cities . '' How does this book relate to adult education ? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s , are we to understand that education took a seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years ? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem . `` Thus the matter resolves itself once more into a question of education , all the more because these people are , miserably almost to a man . '' ( p. 147 ) . He does not forget that this `` education '' is not only for the people , but also for the landlords . `` Clearly , it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant . '' ( p. 270 ) . Riis ' almost language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity . `` It is a fight in which vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society . '' ( p. 233 ) . The relation of this book to the units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the cornerstones of a society . Although this book was in its detail , it was to read while at the time enlightening . I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the races . In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem ; constantly hitting the reader with lists of places and people from another era . Read these names out loud and feel their rhythm : Jewtown , Bandit 's Roost , Double Alley , The Bowery , The Bloody Sixth Ward , The Fourth , Fifth and Tenth Wards , Blindman 's Alley , The Bend , The Battery , Little Italy , The Quarter , Hell 's Kitchen , The West Side , Bottle Alley , Frog Hollow , Poverty Gap , Murderer 's Alley , Gotham Court , The Old Brewery , Old Africa , Potter 's Field , Blackwell 's Island Asylum , Rogues ' Gallery , Penitentiary Row , Chinatown . The list goes on . To someone reared in America , this sounds like a song about another country . Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City : Chinaman ( he ca n't be taught ) , ( Chinese ( coolie -- business ) , Jew ( coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling ) , Jew , Jew ( money is their God ) , Bohemian ( , but thrifty ) , Blacks ( like to gamble , but they are ) , Greek , Hebrews ( tailors , all of them ) , Dutchman , Irish ( like to drink and have funerals ) , ( order loving ) , , Pasquales , Russian , Italian ( a born gambler ; lighthearted and gay ) , Swamp Angel ( thieves ) , Street Arabs ( army of boys ) , Tramps and Toughs ( the world owes them a living ) , and the Celtics . I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis ' comments about every race . I noticed one interesting similarity between the 1800s and the day . Riis says that the gap between the classes is widening . I hear people talking about the growing differences between the and the often these days . Does every generation think that is happening in their time ? Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City ` tenements , but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for change . It is a reminder to show us how the circumstances can become when man 's greed overrides his concern for dignity .\", \"Damaged book The package the book came in was smashed .

I 've never read the ( or any of the parts of the trilogy ) , so I ca n't comment on Karasik and Mazzicchelli 's adaptation . However , I can say that since I 'm not particularly fond of existentialist or literature ( those two terms being the most shorthand for Auster 's story ) , this really did n't do anything for me at all . The story is basically an exercise in metafiction , and if you like that stuff , -- I do not . It is dressed up ( at initially ) in the mystery genre , but that 's just dressing . ( There 's a legacy , especially in France , of cloaking novels and films of ideas in trappings ( for example Alain Robbe-Grillet 's two books The Erasers and The Voyeur , or the films of Jean-Pierre Melville . ) The story begins fairly straightforwardly : a writer of potboiler mysteries named Daniel Quinn lives in New York on his since the death of his wife and son . A stranger calls him and thinks Quinn is a detective named Paul Auster and begs him to to take his case . ( The writer Paul Auster , and his family , shows up for one scene -- it 's that kind of book . ) Quinn meets with the man , who was raised in rather harrowing circumstances by his professor father , who was seeking to discover the language of God . The father has been released from jail and Quinn is supposed to keep an eye on him and report . Everything starts to derail when he loses track of both the man he 's been following , and his clients . He spends months watching the building and going . Once he realizes they 've disappeared , he finds his life has disappeared as well . Obviously this is all somewhat about identity , but it 's about fun stuff like language , representation , and subjects ( as are the two parts of the trilogy , which involve a man spying on someone , and yet another disappearance ) . It has to be said that the artwork does an job of treating the bizarro world Auster has thrust his characters into . The simple , and inking is a match to the material , especially when the representations become less and more . However , if your taste runs more toward things like plots and characters , this is probably not for you . Fans of Auster may enjoy this , but fans of the form are probably going to be much .\", \"Dry , boring and Paul Auster 's City of Glass is perhaps the read I 've experienced . The story moves at a pace that would make a snail ; the murder mystery plot is as as air and hardly resolves itself ; we spend way too waking hours with the character sulking around his apartment staring into a toilet bowl in which he has just defficated -- I kid you not . The part of this novel is the end . I read with fervor to get to the end in hopes that the author would have the talent to tie everything together and make this experience somewhat ; however , I was utterly and discustingly dissapointed beyond my dreams . To all the reviewers and critics who claim this book is a , tour de-force , I beg wholeheartedly with my very life to differ . I believe the author had no thoughts in mind , had no direction when writing this disgrace of a work and it saddens me to see an , piece of fiction with one or two plot devices , gather praise . Like a Rorschach image you can see life , love , death , a myriad of symbols , and if you would like to believe that the person who put that ink blot on the page intended you to see all of that depth , and dwell in that depth -- coming to conclusions and reflecting ultimately on your life , well , then , for you . But in reality , the person that made that Rorschach for you is Auster , and he just ambigoulsy splatted some ink on the pages before you with no ryhme or reason and you All bought it ... hook line and sinker . This novel is an exercise in an authors ability to take us nowhere , show us on the way and still praise , despite an ending which is of the work , in that it plain and simply : sucks\", \"No help at all This book did not teach me anything and was a waste of money . page 364 : Principles of Long term investing : `` Chapter 8 shows that among the S P 500 Index returns , value stocks have a edge over growth stocks .

However , upon opening the book my thought was , `` these all look like school yearbook photos '' , which is exacltly what they are . It seems that that 's primarily what type of photography the author does and his book is geared almost exclusively to that market . His concern , which he stresses throughout the book , is creating a `` picture '' , and he keeps emphasizing the importance of pleasing mom , since she 's usually the one with say over the pictures . A title for this book would have been , `` How To Take School Senior Pictures '' . Even then , of the pictures are not very , both in their execution and in their print quality for this book . In addition , the poses are and looking , and the book is filled with typos and errors .

It does not take faith into consideration . It is a research project based on documents - and falsified ; and none which can be validated . I read it as an follow-up to his work `` Lost Scriptures '' - Books that did not make it into the New Testament . I was warned by my minister who is also a scholar and has two Ph.D. 's - and my minister was . In Lost Christianities , Ehrman seems to make an effort to discredit our books of the New Testament by implying that New Testament books may be , forged , translated incorrectly , altered to serve a purpose , etc ... Ehrman clearly attempts to form a relationship between the New Testament books to those falsified books that did not get into the New Testament . Ehrman 's Lost Christianities starts out , but ends to the point of losing and disinteresting the reader . If for nothing else , it is an attempt to test your faith , but in the end your faith will be strenghtened - if you have faith . The book leads one to believe that the author is as a critic as he claims to be a scholar . He does present all sides of the New Testament story and it is interesting how the New Testament was formed . However , the lack of confirmed and documents will lead one to begin to question if Ehrman is or merely much like the media does . To save you the time and money , simply let your answer any questions you may have on the validity of the New Testament and how came to be . Ehrman and critics ( ie. , The DeVinci Code ) seem to be profiting by creating questions about the truth and validity of the New Testament story . Save your money and give it to your church instead .

Where is his god when he needs him ? Was the victim correct in believing the action ? Was the perpetrator correct in believing his action was right ? In this book , god says that WE have the authority to decide what is or . The action is both and , right ? . This is when you may want to take a look at the Bible . The portrays God as a loving yet HOLY God . Holy is defined as or of devotion as one perfect in goodness and righteousness . He loves us but sees a REAL AND DISTINCT right and as as day where sometimes it appears to be a mass to our senses . He created us and gave us a conscience which can in cases discern a right and in a situation . He gave us a will which allows us to then choose that right or . Are we always going to do the thing ? No , and He knows that . When we do thing , it is at to believe that doing is the thing to do because we desire it . We 're NOT God . We do wrong all the time and God simply wants us to acknowledge this . He wants us to exercise our FREEWILL to do right according to our conscience and what 's told in His book . But he knows that even still we will do when attempting in faith to do right . And that is why in a act of sacrificing Love He sent His Son Jesus Christ to SHOW us the way , sacrifice Himself on the cross for our wrongs , and be there still today to forgive our wrongs when we believe in Him and in the truly thing He did for us . It 's a thing ! I urge you to believe that the Holy Bible is not a lie and Jesus Christ simply did the things the book said He did and is the person He claimed to be . 11 disciples took everything they said and wrote to their grave and never recanted even after persecution . Wow ! I 've been a believer in Christ for almost seven years and He 's continued to worked wonders in my life . I would have been a fan of these books if God had not put me on His path . In case you 're wondering , I gave this book 2 stars because it has reinforced my faith in Christ by giving a glaring example of what God is not . If you 've read through all of this , thank you . I encourage you to write me . God bless !\", \"Use caution in laying all your hopes on yet another `` cure . '' My year daughter was diagnosed with autism at age 2 and we took a approach , including things like supplements , a GFCF diet , and OT/PT/speech . After a year on the GFCF diet and supplements and no change in behaviors , we went back to a diet with vitamin supplements and continued her therapies . Our friends ' daughter , now age 4 and also diagnosed with autism , took a approach , but even , following the DAN protocol as well as the recommendations of this book , including chelation , a array of supplements , GFCF diet , OT/PT/Speech , ABA , etc . While our child has made advances , or friends ' child has not , beyond advances related to her age -- at 4 , she is still , far from trained , exhibits behaviors , and needs verbal and cues for the tasks . The point I am trying to make is that every child is and no one , NO ONE has shown that one course of therapy cures or even convincingly improves a percentage of children with autism . Autism , as of you likely know well , is a term . Our friends ' daughter no doubt has a very kind of pathology than ours . I have yet to really see a book or study address that fact first and foremost before offering a course of action , rather than immediately launching into predictions of one `` cure '' for a range of issues . While I do think some of what the author recommends can be ( and it really may offer a help for some children with autism ) , some of the therapies ( like chelation ) can be very -- in fact , I have yet to see one of the families who tried chelation therapy see improvement in their child 's symptoms . I have seen success with GFCF diets ( for a percentage of children ) , but the success seems to come with therapy . I certainly understand where families are coming from -- I have been there myself , but treating your child like a guinea pig and attempting to `` cure '' them with substances that have had very study/peer review in a frenzy of worry is both to their bodies and to their emotions . As with anything , balance is your approach will serve you and your child well .\", \"very very do n't buy this book , no substance only for sale\", \"Wow ... ... . you can get all three of these books in one neat volume !

'' Instead I have focused on `` Of Mice and Men '' and his lesser known works , as `` To a God Unknown '' and , my favorite , `` Pastures of Heaven . '' I 've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in . When I began reading `` In Dubious Battle , '' it appeared the most of all Steinbeck 's work . Telling the story of American Communist party workers Jim and Mac , it begins with the story of Jim initiating himself into Mac 's cell . There is a ( and misleading ) sense of intrigue - Mac and Jim travel by boxcar , work secretly through letters , go from contact to contact and finally among orchard workers . Early on , the pace is fast , exciting , and engaging . Suddenly , Steinbeck simply fails to deliver , leaving the reader wondering when he 's going to pick up the pace again . After Jim and Mac slowly initiate a worker 's strike , I expected the sense of excitement to continue . It simply never does . Summary of `` In Battle '' - Workers get . Workers get tired . Workers get . Workers get tired . Workers get . Workers get tired . The rest of the book mostly concerns Jim and Mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking . And while their chats are mildly interesting at , they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book . of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration , and of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over nonsense ... ... and eating . Steinbeck must have been while writing this story , because at a 25 % of the story concerns finding , eating , and ( of all ) TALKING about food . There is plenty of action that Steinbeck could have shown during the story , but for some reason he prefers to focus on Jim and Mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment , discussing whatever comes to mind . Steinbeck 's sense of intrigue and injustice is reading the chapters . But I advise any reader of `` In Battle '' to take this course - after the strike is initiated , simply set the book down . You wo n't miss anything . Nothing of import happens , and only a very characters ever surface , and they are lost among the sea of faces . I suppose now I 'll give `` Grapes of Wrath '' a go . Perhaps if it is n't one of his `` greats , '' it is n't reading\", \"not an history of money This is the sort of book you get when an author writes on a subject with which he has only a passing familiarity , and lacks the confidence that the matter is inherently enough to hold the reader 's attention . The result is a book that is ultimately . One symptom of the problems described above is that portions are devoted to subjects than money . For example , the author uses the three pages after the introduction to describe Aztec sacrifice in literally detail before proceeding on to the use of cocao beans as commodity money . I think that 's meant to be what they used to call in show business a `` grabber , '' but for the reader expecting to learn about money , it 's a distraction . Another problem is that the author 's grasp of economics is at , and especially in the part of the book , he 'll make a point and then repeat himself , much as an trying to extend the length of a term paper that 's run a pages short . And yet , there 's also some and oddly tidbits of information here . The author states that L. Frank Baum 's 1900 book `` The Wizard of Oz '' is really a about the need for a dollar based on both gold and silver . But even as it strikes you that this is an bit of trivia , you realize that it 's only a bit of trivia and has significance . If you 're looking for a history of money , you should look elsewhere .

I 've read three King books that have had the passages with depictions of horror , doom , and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story . This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really and . And this is exactly what `` Insomnia '' is . This is n't a spoiler , just the author 's note : at the end of the book we read 10 , Nov 10 , three years in which King took to write this book . Three years which were evidently wasted . The King books I 've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification . `` Insomnia 's '' Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with . He is , kind , has gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and . His counterpart Lois Chasse does n't come across as . Instead she serves as a character who has no flair or identity than being in love with Ralph . King does n't usually do that with his characters . characters with roles in this book come across as and , like Ed and Helen Deepenau , the three bald doctors , and Ralph 's confidantes . Then there 's the abortion mess . This issue crumbles midway and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story . Though King does provide an and seemingly commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker ( albeit with a tranparently slant ) , it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no than a story device . I gave the book two stars because I am an writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are to utilize as part of a writer 's arsenal . The devices were and all thru the reading I asked myself , 'How is King going to get through this ? ' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert 's narration ( via third person ) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance . It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story , he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him . This is a tool for a beginning writer , but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning . One thing , the villians just do n't work . They are not frightening , they are not , they are not or malign . Three doctors with scalpels and scissors ? Their defining characteristics are being and does that really frighten anyone ? The villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his madness .

His cynicism drips from almost every sentence and his contempt for all things Objectivism is to anyone who takes ideas seriously .

To characterize the movement as a cult may have had some validity in the years prior to her death , but only in the most sense of the word . Right now the ranks of Objectivism are swelling with people who differ in background AND in opinion . Mr. Walker 's principle mistake is looking at Objectivism as something that was born exclusively from the mind of Ayn Rand ... something Miss Rand herself would disagree with . Objectivism is the continuation of a line of thought that views mankind as a reasoning animal ... a line that extends back through history and begins ( explicitly ) with Aristotle . Those ( like Mr. Walker ) who dismiss it on the basis of Miss Rand 's personality and the culture of people that grew around her in her lifetime are truly missing an opportunity to enlighten themselves . There is no doubt Ayn Rand is a figure ; my advice to those inclined to read Mr. Walker 's book is to read Miss Rand 's books as well . Particularly her non-fiction .

The point is , this is essentially the book . It is a book which convinces the reader of the almost power of Prozac by sharing stories like these . What is disturbing is that I now know the truth . Research investigations have found that the power of antidepressants has increased dramatically . They are now more because our belief in the power of a pill to cure shyness , anxiety , depression , and a temper has increased dramatically . We have come to believe , as Kramer puts it , `` biology is '' ( page xiv ) . No where does Kramer explain that the of the trial used to get approval of Prozac to market was only 8 weeks long . No where does he share that a tranquilizer was given to study subjects and the tricks used to make the effectiveness of the drug appear than it really is . The dangers of use ( diabetes , Parkinson 's disease , muscle jerking , etc . ) are never discussed . ( Of course , these problems were still when Kramer wrote . ) See Timothy Scott 's wonderful , and unlike Kramer 's book , carefully documented book America Fooled : The Truth About Antidepressants , Antipsychotics , and How We 've Been Fooled to find the dangers as well as what does bring health .

For those not already with the authors ' theory , Strauss and Howe are two authors who began writing about generations in 1991 . They wrote the book Generations , which introduced a theory that generations fall into four types , and each type comes of age during a kind of era , or `` '' . The Generation is of the `` '' type , for instance , , , and in tune with their emotions , and came of age during the Golden Age of postwar America . The Baby Boomers , remembered for their `` Awakening '' in the 1960s , are of the `` idealist '' type , concerned with God and spirituality and impassioned about what they believe in , but inclined to change during life ( from hippie to the `` Just say no '' control freak ) . Generation X , which they named the Thirteenth Generation , is of the `` '' type , being alienated , and , without a feeling of need to be `` '' to anything , coming of age during the 1980s and 1990s . They then first identified everyone born since 1982 as the `` Generation '' , and predicted back in 1991 that it would be grow up to be , and , just like the G.I . Generation that World War II , going back to the `` civic '' type generation before the Generation . In 1993 they published the book Thirteenth Gen , which specialized in Generation X and why they are the way they are . In their book , The Fourth Turning , they went back to the theory and writing about all the generations . They also changed the names from , idealist , and to Artist , Prophet , Nomad and Hero . Strauss and Howe wrote in this book about an era of battle and mass destruction , much like the one in which the G.I . Generation came of age . They then predicted the Generation would form the role of Heroes during the coming crisis , and they would lower pregnancy rates , stop using drugs , serve the United States , in even , and desist with using profanity . So then in 2000 they put out this book , Millennials Rising . In this one the authors try to explain the Millennial Generation ( my generation ) . Millennials Rising attempts to identify who we , the most ethnically generation in history as they note , are . In Millennials Rising they write about this generation 's Boomer parents and their influence on the Millennial Generation , as well as the kind of world in which this generation is growing up ( which S H think of as hundreds of television channels , SUV lifestyles , rappers who swear , and people who smack each on TV ) . The book states that Millennials want to work together in teams , believe the people in authority know about right and than they do , are about learning and going to school , are loved and protected by their parents , achieve things in school and will achieve things in the future , and we forget , always want to exude that `` peer pressure '' on their Millennials . The obviously leads to the question , then , is the generation really , and just as they say ? Consider this : Only 28 % of school seniors say that the work they get assigned at school is `` '' , only 21 % describe their courses as `` '' and still barely over a , 39 % , believe that what they do in school will have any relation to their success later in life . The generation was supposed to be about learning . The Generation also rapidly increased drug use , especially , from the level at which Generation X was using them in its teens , as even the authors themselves note . S H portray the world of entertainment , as television shows , movies and music , as a battle . In music , for instance , artists are described by extremes that either represent the alleged Millennial values or go actively against them -- on one side , artists like Eminem , Limp Bizkit and Marilyn Manson , on the , bands and Britney Spears and her imitators , along with bands as the S Club 7 . They do not deal with the interest in bands that lie somewhere in between the two . For instance , Blink-182 is just about the band around now , and yet Millennials Rising does not mention Blink-182 and the fans who make the band a success . South Park : Bigger , Longer , Uncut is the authors ' idea of where culture is today . Millennials Rising heralds bands as what music will increasingly be like as the decade unfolds , and blasts the `` '' bands as groups that will be washed away , but could the authors have predicted bands like Good Charlotte or artists like Avril Lavigne ? This leads to the question of whether the book and the theory will be to predict anything . S H write about `` rebelling by being '' during the decade . Apparently , their idea of rebellion is not listening to Limp Bizkit , blasting censorship , or doing drugs , but wearing clothes , waiting until marriage to have sex , and trusting their government . According to them , we should expect to see Millennials petitioning for policies that will punish their peers . S H write that we will accept the draft and join the in numbers when the crisis presents us with a war , and even do National Service . Frankly , can anyone imagine any than 20 % of today 's school students doing their duty and risking their life in war in the name of America ? Also , our generation has done nothing to make a commitment to following Bush as leader during the Iraq War , while S H predict Millennials serving their president . How to a Hero generation is that ? The G.I . Generation followed FDR so blindly they had to print his campaign materials in Braille . When it comes to rallying around their president and leading the direction of the nation during a crisis , Millennials have surely disappointed those who expected them to do just as the authors said we would . This , of course , does not have to be a thing , but it does make you wonder about the limitations of the abilities of the theory . Some parts of it make for very reading , but all the talk about how they are to be the `` '' generation gets to you sometimes . S H seem to believe you can never think too about those Millennials . Millennials Rising presents an image of youth that is set to amaze you and will attract readers , but sometimes what the book describes just is n't happening\", \"Get the picture elsewhere It certainly is no surprise with the development of technology and expansion of capitalism that workers are the future in Society .

It introduces the stage metaphor into sociology ; all of interaction is a performance on a stage . It 's how novel this metaphor is , but this is certianly its statement . The language used to present the ideas of the author is , like writing , unecessarily complicated . There are some problems with clarity and structure ; the book just doesnt have a feel for me . No background is presupposed , there is quoting from sources , footnotes , and ways to enter literature throught the book . So if you are in reading sociology , this is probably a place to start ( again , the language is thick and this may be it 's bane as an introduction ) . However , the book is misguided . The idea of viewing interaction as a performance on a stage is . The authors motives for saying this will make my position clearer . ( The following is a charicature of the author 's argument ) . There is certianly a amount of behavior which is directed towards people ( the audience ) in order for the audience to build an impression of the actor . Well , if it can happen here we can draw a with situations , infact all situations and therfore all of interaction is like a performance on a stage , `` All the world is not , of course , a stage , but the ways in which it isnt are to specify '' ( p 72 ) . The performances can either be with individuals , or groups of people , and they can be performing conciously or unconciously . ( end of charicature ) There are arguments , obviously , and the statement `` we can draw a with situations '' is of the content of the book , which i dont like to gloss over with a sentence . But the question here is , is the view worthwhile ? My answer : No . Social interaction is a phenomena that cant possibly be summed up with a signle metaphor . Yes , some interaction is like a performance , where indivudals are intentionally making impressions on one another . Yes , some behavior can arise from beliefs . However , interaction is exactly the way we see it , conciously controlled , , interaction with individuals ; it is not some kind of performance with the purpose of creating a `` reality '' . I hope my view of the book is so that the biases on the part of my review can be sorted out : the book is a waste of time . Where the author is , the statement is little than sense . Where the author goes outside of sense , he 's , sometimes plainly so . This book is part of the tradition in sociology of thinking that society pulls the wool over each individuals eyes , that reality is a construct with no purpose than control ( here the wool is the performance , and the control has to do with impressions ... but this quickly degenerates into an mess of assertions ) . There is no support given for of the claims . Where `` evidence '' is given , the evididence is so heavily intepreted that it fails to correspond to facts in the world but rather to facts about the views of the reporter . Where there is no correspondence to the world there is no truth . sources of sociology are cited , but this is more like bullying . Saying that some author , which also didnt have any support for his claims , agrees with you is just to bully your reader into acepting your claims . The claims in the book have no application in the world , but only serve to intepret situations differently , and in opinion , less correctly . Nothing said here will lead to predictions about behavior or a understanding of psychology . In , this isnt a study at all . My qualm with the book deserves its paragraph , the use of language . The example is the definitions given at the end of the introduction `` A performance may be defined as all of the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of the participants '' ( 15 ) . This is a definition . Me breathing while work is a performance , it changes the percentages of O2 and CO2 in the atmosphere near my co-workers . Me staring into space is a performance , people see me stare into space and are therefore . Infact , me simply existing is a performance , since my existance causes a effect on the participants , as well as influencing them to create beliefs about me existing . Its as if Goffman created a definition for performance which included all actions taken by any person , and then wrote a book about how all actions taken by any person fall under the category of performance . He didnt . He used a word that we associate with behavior ( performance ) and defined it in a way no one is used to . Then he used alot of word play to show that behavior has no substance , its all for the purpose of maintaining reality . I hope this very example shows the use of language that is to Goffman and sociology more generally . So an ode to sociology is in order ... actually no it isnt . Why wont this subject go away ? This book is an part of sociology , and it espouses the methods and style of researchers and writers by being an work within the tradition . The methods are ; the style is . Like it or hate it , sociology is a part of thought .

I loved I am Legend and seeing the list of books this guy has written which had been developed into horror movies ( Hell House included ) I was really to read this . I have heard complaints about the book from calling it `` porn '' to `` sick porn '' and then even being offended by the sacrilege present in the tale . Sacrilege in a book called ... Hell House is probably something you need to come to terms with before picking it up . Attacking the author because of the content is really something that is not . I doubt these were Mathis ' `` fantasies '' in the book but more his idea of melding something together with something terrifying . It is an way to convey horror to a reader . to enacting violence on children , or , babies in cinema ( try watching the Hills Have Eyes without being on the edge of your seat while the villains in the movie dangle the fate of an infant in your face ) . Mathis should not be condemned for content . Here is what he did right . He took the idea of a haunted house and brought it into the world of science . like I am Legend used science to define its vampires , Hell House uses science to define hauntings and it is very well researched and within the framework of the story . The parts may be more . His characterization is . There are four characters really and their personalities do not define them . You will remember Barrett by his limp , Fishcer by his fear , Florence by her beliefs , and Edith ... well because there is no one else . They are paper and have no motivations . The pacing seems too . A lot of moments are left on revelations in the point of view characters mind which that character has not fully processed because the chapter ends before they can relay it and all of its profound meaning to you , the reader . As a matter of fact the revelations themselves , when all is said and done , are really pretty . There is also a habit characters have , when going into lengths of exposition that goes on for pages , to cup their hands around a coffee cup . It seems too like a commercial for me ! Anyway , the book hardly slows down for characterization or details and we get very descriptions in the book . Sometimes I wanted to know what things looked like , I wanted imagery not just exposition for pages . What was it about the atmosphere that , say Fischer found so ? We needed the scenes to be developed . By the end I was so of lines like : '' God do you know what this means ? '' `` What ? '' `` I ca n't tell you now but it 's ' !

The fear should come through our attachment to the characters not the mystery of the house because the mystery of the house is kind of . This book is not it , unfortunately .

I was captivated by the story line as I read the dust jacket , but found that the writing was not nearly as . I thought the author way too pages with matters of no interest , and very addressing the theme of the book . Although wanting to relate sympathetically to the book 's hero , I just was n't drawn in to care about him .

I expect an Atlas to use maps to explain rather than words . The maps that are in the book are , but sections do not have one . The book is split into sections/topics written by persons . However , in sections the text ends in mid-sentence , as if pages were forgotten about in each section or as if there was some cutoff on the # of words per section . of this 200 page book , sentence cutoffs appear on these pages . Each page also represents the end of a section . p.37,55,63,82,89,96,115,141,149,163 , and 175 clearly , not just a oversight . Also , the table of contents is , as it primarily denotes the sections - which is by , but not the topics .

Between the seafaring jargon - which must have delighted boys of yore - and the dialects , it can take ages to puzzle out a page . Some of the anecdotes related by the seamen of the schooner `` We 're Here , '' which has picked up Harvey Cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner , I could not grasp the point or moral of . My husband has read all the Patrick O'Brian series , so I asked him to puzzle out a story , that of Counahan the Navigator , and after spending 15 minutes reading me a pages aloud and filling me in on the terms he understood , he said , `` Honey , I see what you mean . '' One can get the gist , but it 's best to read through fast , then go back and see if any of it makes any sense . For example , when educated Harvey says , `` Why ca n't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories ? '' his Dan answers , `` Allus can , till we begin to dress daown . Efter thet , the heads and offals , ' 'd scare the fish to Fundy . Boat-fishin ' ai n't reckoned , though , unless ye know as as dad knows .

A days ago , a friend showed us the DVD of the 1937 movie , starring Spencer Tracy and Lionel Barrymore , on his screen home theater , and it was thrilling and very moving . The movie is quite from the book , though , but it may give some incentive to check out for oneself how Kipling crafted the story , as it did for me . But teachers , PLEASE , do not students to this title unless you are going to spend the semester on it and are to turn them off literature forever !

I would definitely not recommend this book for anyone under 18 ! If you like operas , you may enjoy this book a lot . If you are searching for the secrets of Rose Red or a ghost story , this is not your book . I read the story before the author was made known . I thought it might be Stephen King or Tabitha King . The writing style was far below Stephen King 's style and it was very , which I suspected Tabitha King to be the author . However , the accounts of Ellen were obviously written by a man , as the episodes were definitely not from the viewpoint of a woman . So , it was no surprise when the author was neither Stephen nor Tabitha , but a author I have never heard of . The book reveals almost nothing about Rose Red and it 's secrets . I would dare say that 90 % of the diary goes on and on about Ellen and John 's wealth and extremely marriage . On and on about John 's affairs , Ellen 's withholding of favors , affairs , more withholding of favors , affairs , favors withheld . The story is a circle regarding this . It 's almost like she gets burned , but yet continues to play with fire . Very and almost , as you read the scenarios redundantly . By the time , you know exactly what he 's doing and how she will retaliate . Silly . I mentioned above that the Diary of Ellem Rimbauer revealed no secrets of the house . In fact , as the progresses , it skips four occurrences ( it made mention of the four , like `` by the way , four disappearances happened since time I wrote , but I wo n't tell you about them '' ) . And this I found - ***SPOILER ALERT*** Ellen waits some three or so years for a from a master . Three years . But after the , nothing is revealed ! The book is riddled with episodes like this . Some secret is coming . When it finally is revealed , it 's no at all . It 's something , like `` yes , there are spirits in the house '' . What spirits ? Why ? Who ? Nothing is ever satisfactorily explained . I would have given it one star , however it seemed to have a quality . At the start of the , Ellen was an 19 year to John . Soon , she is corrupted by John , wealth , maybe corrupted by her friend ( jury is still out ) , and hatred . She prays to God , but also to `` her god '' ( the dark one ) . At , you suppose she is playing with fire . Right on . She gets consumed by darkness , revenge , and hatred and falls into destruction . , I personally thought it read like fiction .

The Prologue begins with a photo of POWs at the end of WWI . The photo caption states that the Army at the end of WWI was `` '' and implies that Germany capitulated because of a loss of will on the part of its leadership . This is doubly misleading . The Army was soundly defeated on Front in 1918 and then began to disintegrate . In 1918 , Germany was essentially a dictatorship run by Ludendorff and Hindenberg . The leaders who lost will were the High Command . Defeat on the battlefield and despair on the part of commanders hardly meets the description of an army . Keegan is essentially repeating the `` stab in the back '' myth used by the and wing propagandists to undermine the Weimar republic . Its astonishing to see this published decades later by someone who is supposed to be an expert on matters . This type of error recurs throughout this book . My relatively error is Keegan moving the Ploesti oilfields , a resource , from Romania to Hungary . See reader reviews for documentation of a number of errors of varying magnitude . Just as and in some cases even more are Keegan 's failures to discuss aspects of WWII . He makes effort , for example , to discuss the origins of the war . Indeed , his paragraphs on this topic suggest that he finds it too confusing to discuss . Leaving aside his shirking of his obligation to discuss this topic , there are overviews of 20s and 30s that are guides to this admittedly topic . Instead of an effort to discuss the origins of the war , we get a and somewhat discussion of how industrialization transformed technology and organization . Instead of a discussion of the history of the Weimar Republic , for understanding the ascent of the Nazis , we get another discussion of the Freikorps phenomenon . Among omissions are his failure to grapple with the significance of the Allied bombing campaign against Germany , a issue analyzed insightfully by Richard Overy in 2 of his books . Keegan 's discussion of the Holocaust in both and implicitly misleading . Partly because he does n't discuss the origins of the war and the role played by Nazi ideology in starting the war he fails to show that in respects the Holocaust was the point of aggression . The Nazis went to war not just to overturn the Versailles settlement or even to conquer Eastern Europe , but to impose their notions of conflict on the rest of Europe . Without this background , its to understand the outbreak and the nature of WWII . Among things , Nazi racism prevented them from rationally exploiting the resources of the Soviet Union , a factor in their defeat . As pointed out by reviewers , Keegan devotes a amount of the book to activities of the allies when the Eastern front was really the theatre . To be to Keegan , writing a concise 1 volume book like this is very . The 1 volume work on WWII is Gerhard Weinberg 's book , which is about 1000 pages of text in a fairly font . Some of the sections of this book are quite and Keegan has a , sometimes actually , writing style . None of these features , however , can overcome his neglect of features of WWII and the lack of attention to facts . This is not just error , this is negligence .\", \"Acupressure Techniques : A Self Help Guide This book is almost for helping someone understand how to use acupressure to alleviate symptoms .

Everyone recognizes that far books are being written and published than can be read . Why are people so to be authors in a market ? One reason , apparently embraced by the Goldstones , is that it is so to write a book ! All you have to do is write down some reminiscences of your experiences . They do n't have to be particularly experiences . You do n't have to do any research into your subject . If you describe what all the people you encounter are wearing , if you go into details of how you found a babysitter for each trip you took , if you quote phone calls from relatives and shop keepers ( even if they are not or ) , and if you describe the hotel rooms you stayed in , you can finish the book in a couple of weekends ! And readers can finish the book in a couple of hours with harm done . The book does accurately represent the travails of beginning book collectors , and I recognized some of my experiences in the stories the authors tell . However , the book does not take the effort to educate readers so that they can skip over errors , nor does it attempt to answer of the questions that the authors themselves raised when they first began collecting . What determines the price of books ? Why are editions ? Why should Tarzan books cost than works of literature ? These are questions that anyone might think of when getting into book collecting , and you will find the questions but not the answers here . The book is written in a breezy style that is to get through , and if you have two hours at an airport to kill , you could do than to read it . But by the time you arrive at your destination , you will have likely forgotten of what you just read , because so of it is details of the authors ' lives , transportation problems , and experiences . If you are really in book collecting , it would be to read one of the books that describe what one should look for , how prices are determined , styles of book collecting , and so on . Fragments of this knowledge are transmitted in this book , but they will leave you with questions than answers . To be , not every book about book collecting needs to be a font of wisdom .

Choose `` Watership Down '' or Fans of the ABC-TV show `` LOST '' will probably be buying `` Our Friend '' in droves after having seen Desmond keeping it to be the `` book [ I ] ever [ ] '' . Since I did not have to buy it , having purchased a set of Dickens years ago , I immediately set out to read it . What a disappointment it was ! Dickens wrote it on an basis publishing it in a magazine over a 19 month period . One can not avoid a suspicion while reading it that it is , just a bit , perhaps , 'padded ' . Any editor could have tightened it up at 200 pages . Dickens ' work is , but some of it is just than is with art . As Oscar Wilde said of 'The Old Curiosity Shop ' , `` I simply can not read of the death of Little Nell without laughing . '' 'OMF ' goes quickly down to this level of bathos and remains there to the sentence . Even is the ending . Some endings just ca n't help but feel contrived ; and Dickens , having gotten a number of his characters into positions , pulls so colored rabbits out of his hat that the reader simply cheated . All of this may seem rather harsh from someone who was to shell out hundreds of dollars for `` The Complete Oxford Illustrated Dickens '' but I assure you that my concern is for you , reader . Unless you are possessed of time to read the whole of Dickens ' oeuvre or are required to read `` Our Friend '' , I would , instead , you to Dickens ' far works : 'David Copperfield ' , 'Oliver Twist ' , 'Pickwick Papers ' . If you are looking for 'LOST ' reading material , I would refer you to 'Watership Down ' ( Excellent ) , 'The Stand ' ( by Stephen King , entertainment , not literature ) , 'The Dark Tower ' series ( by Stephen King , entertainment , not literature , and to 'Our Mutual Friend ' possessed of a fatally flawed ending ) or a review of philosophy like 'Locke , Rousseau and Hume ' .

What a bunch of baloney . First of all , evolution , in the sense of `` descent , '' is not . Even ID-iot superstars Michael Behe , Stephen Meyer , and Jonathan Wells have admitted as . ( See a summary of their testimony in the Kansas biology curriculum hearings in the evolution/creationism forum at the West Virginia Gazette . ( wvgazettemail ) ( put `` /forums '' after com ) So any ID-iot who thinks all that bafflegab about complexity ( IC ) and the nonsense in this film is the death knell of evolution is simply . Man evolved from ancestors . Get over it . Thaxton in ought to read that summary , since he himself was one of the witnesses and looked particularly . In any case , the data discussed in this book is indeed nothing but bafflegab . Talking about the allegedly foundation for design makes it sound deliciously , especially to poorly educated ID-iots , who generally are about science ; but even if the data is , it 's nothing but a facade , because it has nothing to do with the book 's conclusion . For example , imagine your neighbor told you that his dog could play Beethoven concertos on the piano . Skeptical , you ask for proof . `` , '' your neighbor replies . `` See , here 's my dog , and there 's my piano . '' Only a moron would accept that as `` proof , '' and yet ID-iot Christians are more than to accept exactly that kind of `` proof '' from films like this . The problem with your neighbor 's `` proof '' is that it proves only the existence of the dog and the existence of the piano . Neither of those issues , however , was the cause of your skepticism , so the `` proof '' was entirely . The issue , of course , was not the existence of the dog and the piano , but rather the ability of the dog to play the piano , and your neighbor 's `` proof '' was completely on that issue . Again , only a moron would accept evidence of existence as proof of ability . In this book , there 's a lot of talk about how systems are . That is nothing but meaningless bafflegab , because the existence of systems is not a issue . The issue is how those systems came into being , and on that issue the book 's `` evidence '' is completely . This book was designed to fool poorly educated , easily ID-iots . Judging from the reviews , it seems to have succeeded . Well , there 's a sucker born every minute , and apparently a lot of them are found in churches and seminaries . In one of the very evolution debates , Thomas Huxley accused Bishop Wilberforce of using his and gifts to mislead and bamboozle people . Things have n't changed much since then . Instead of evidence , this book substitutes a argument . `` Gee , look how it is . It must have been created by an designer . Maybe , just maybe , it was God . Wink , wink . '' arguments are . Only suckers are taken in by them .

Elsewhere , mycocardia problems with controlled animal tests using water have been known since 1996 but are suspiciously avoided by the organizations which promote water . Common sense nutrition tells us that if one is concerned about food intake , then the use of foods with fibre and pH liquid is the answer . promoters would have you dilute your blood pH with alkalinity thus inducing problems which may put you in the emergency room as my medic ( 1985 Nobel Prize recipient ) clearly points out . You might as well drink battery acid he said , the result will be the stress on your blood pH . Here is a medic who is not an expert in water but in medicine cautioning against forced dilution of blood pH . He continued by saying that when that much alkalinity is added to the system , the very pH which naturally occurs in the tract is neutralized and food is not metabolized properly . The amino acids which are in the process are no longer and food putrifies and nutrition suffers . The alkaline promoters , including this book 's author have been sniffing glue in a closet and are simply out of touch with even the very basics of body chemistry and processes .

I have never actually thrown a book across the room in frustration - and I love books , so this is ! Spoilers ahead - please do n't read on if you have n't read the book . I managed to ( somehow ) get through the book , 'Wideacre ' , which I disliked - whilst I adore the rest of Gregory 's novels , so this was for me - and grit my teeth and tried to read this book , the sequel as I 'd bought it and it looked more . It was 'marginally ' as one reader put it , than the , but a very and book indeed . I was getting very and frustrated after the half of the book - as readers have highlighted , Julia 's inability to stand up to Richard made it for me to like her anymore . I quite honestly wanted to slap her to wake her up from that dreamy state she was in ! Because I wanted so for Julia to be with James - who I liked a deal . I was so after everything went and she did n't marry him ... ah , because I was expecting the usually very Ms Gregory to surprise me and have a twist at the end and say , aha ! She does get her love in the end and she and Ralph get of Richard and although it 's not happily ever after she learns to grow a backbone and be the very female heir to Wideacre . The rape scene with Julia and Richard was very and far too and I think it may be to stomach for anyone who has ever been in an situation like that , in fact , for anyone at all . I do n't want to get into the area of abortion too , but I really did feel strongly that Julia should have gone to Ralph for help when she concieved the child with Richard . This was a child of incest and rape - and she knew in her heart there should be no heir for Wideacre - they were all simply too and it needed to end somewhere for nothing was going right . slate , so to speak . Yet she gives the child away - then in her letter asks James to find the child ? ! What ? ! And I was expecting perhaps a child , after all this inbreeding ( I mean this child is the product of parents who are brother and AND grandparents who are brother and sister ! ! ! ) but she was and . I was hoping the gypsies would keep her and she 'd never be found again.. but alas , the Lacey madness will live on ... The end to this book would have been a twist . Gregory could have made her very point about inheritance rights and the lack of power women of Beatrice and Julia 's era had by Richard being killed by Ralph , then Julia inheriting the land - baby Sarah is adopted out to the gypsies and never seen again and Julia either lives as a widow and runs the land or ( this would have been lovely - I bet all the girls have sighed over James a , did n't you ? he was a like the leads in Austen 's books ) James forgave her - for they had both made mistakes and Julia 's was not nor her fault ( I was practically screaming at her that it was n't her fault - and she gets it in the end , when it 's too ! ) and they marry and have 'normal ' children - or perhaps none , they just learn from their mistakes and respect each , and make a start for Wideacre . There were so allies that Julia had - she was a girl and I liked her - I wish that I could have shaken her though , I got so . So people in the village offered their help - this trap she was caught in with Richard could have been avoided - ahhh ... SO . I will not be reading the book in the series . I shall go back to reading Gregory 's novels ( A Constant Princess is one I have n't read yet and it sounds ) .

How would people pay for this service ? How far would they go to protect it ? What are the implications ? Robin Cook comes circle , returning to the themes of his 1970s novel , Coma . Coma is the novel that first made us of the dangers of medicine and greed ; of the subtle but destruction of the relationships patients had with doctors , and the dignity those relationship once preserved . Now , a quarter century later , Robin Cook is shown to have been eerily as technology has caught up to his nightmare . Chromosome 6 is a very scenario of a technology designed with the of intentions being corrupted for the sake of profit . In this novel , there is mystery and murder ; sleuthing and , sets . There are a host of characters whose paths will intersect at some point-the set up is and we read with anticipation-but ... this novel is so poorly written that I can not believe it has Robin Cook 's name on it . Though not literature , Robin Cook 's novels have always been and , with characters and settings that seemed . The characters in Chromosome 6 are as as road kill , the action as down as a glass of coke left in the sun until all of the ice has melted . Turn a page and the story just ends ... what ? That 's it ? Are you kidding ? Did Robin Cook really write this ? I do n't think so .\", \"K is for killer ... Well , if anything this was a decently written story , with dialect and character detail . However , this story felt like it was going around in circles without any indication of ever ending . Grafton seems to have an idea of where she wants to go with this story but never really gets there . The story starts off with PI Kinsey Milhone in her office at night when she hears a knock on her door . She opens it to find Janice Kepler , mother of Lorna Kepler standing before her with the tale of her daughter 's death . Not only this , but she also explains to Kinsey about how no one ever solved the murder because Lorna 's body was left to decompose for months in her cabin house . They talk for a while about the circumstances surrounding her daughter 's death until Janice tells Kinsey about a video that was sent to her house after Lorna 's death . This tape leads Kinsey on a chase of suspects in the light district and gets her nowhere when it comes to turning over the murderer . Millhone dives even further and searches through the world of Lorna 's day job where she uncovers a lead about an , elaborate project which is angering people a amount . Kinsey also checks up on Lorna 's family members , and with the exception of Janice , all seem to have a motive to murder her Lorna . Not being a fan of these types of novels , I decided to at give it a chance but this story got me nowhere . By the middle of the novel I wanted to give up and skip to the end of the story , but when I got to the end I had to go back to the middle to figure out how everything ended . I stopped caring about the murder after so much emphasis was placed on so side stories and it seemed like Grafton did too . The ending left me with a feeling and I did n't know if the book had actually ended . All in all , it was just not the kind of book for me but if you 're a murder mystery fan , try any of Grafton 's alphabet themed novels besides this one\", \"book with a thinking after get shorty , e.l. might just wish shamelessly that his book with those palmer characters might hit the goldmine and pay dirt and being bought up by the hollywood producers and made into another movie again , with this purpose focused , wrote this totally sequel to get . and he was right again , it was bought and made into a movie again , but pathetically , a one compared to get shorty . the itself was also a failure with so evidences that e.l. indeed wrote it in a way for another movie in mind . i simply failed to find there 's any interest in reading this going nowhere story . it just like reading a e.l. personified in chili palmer and lobbying so to make this novel into a movie , with all the script , dialogue readymade for hollywood to grap . how could you imagine that those winnos in los angeles , especially those who in the hiphop music biz would watch 'charlie rose ' and would have known and recognized chili palmer as the producer of 'get shorty ' ? you think those people would faithfully turned on their tv and channel surfed to pbs to watch 'charlie rose ' ? and at every corner of angeles , every table in any restaurant , almost everyone would recognize 'chili palmer ' ? and you have to ask yourself : since when people would recognize a movie producer , even a director in person ? even they stand in front of you and claim themselves they are ? yeah , maybe elmore would watch 'charlie rose ' regularly ? and you think that charlie rose would interview a shylock in his show ? give me a break ! this book , from the 1st page to the was an absolutely no-brainer , so and so ! just a and cash-in\", \"Dreaming Water Gail 's writing is again in this in book , but I found the book disappointing to a lack of closure .

I would n't go so far as the reviewer and dismiss it as quot ; quot ; , but it 's certainly : Postman seems to rely on sources about Enlightenment thought , rather than any reading of Enlightenment texts . The idea of quot ; building a bridge to the century quot ; seems more like a marketing device , a way of presenting some of Postman 's themes , than a proposition ( He even includes a summary of his quot ; disappearance of childhood quot ; argument in an appendix ) . It 's a shame , really , because the Enlightenment has been getting too undeservedly press for far too , and Postman is when he points out that we owe much of what 's and about society to Enlightened thinking .

I do n't mind authors skipping over details of computer systems to keep the plot moving , but if the author decides to provide descriptions of encrytion codes , firewalls and hacking techniques , those details must be fairly . In this case , the details were so wildly that I finally had to stop reading . The part where hackers were gradually forcing their way through a firewall to access NSA data were particularly to read without becoming distracted by the absurd details . The NSA almost certainly does n't have computers with highly classified data connected to the internet ( through any combination of firewalls ) but if they did , they could simply disconnect the internet connection if they were being hacked .

Facing an irate publisher , he then filled in the 290 pages with his Economics lecture notes . As a result , readers who have taken an economics course will find of the material repetitive , while those who have not will most find the material too confusing to be of any use . ( Despite the glowing accolades on the cover , the author 's explanations are no than those in a textbook . ) The author also posits questions for the reader to ruminate upon , but does not provide any answers . Aside from textbooks where questions are intended to be assigned to students , tactics are . Of course , the author may be priming the pump for sales of a `` Hidden Order Supplement '' . A point is the author 's tone , which is frequently condescending towards the reader ( . telling the reader they would not understand the math behind a given theory , so it will not even be presented ) . While this may be for a layperson reading the book , being talked down to certainly does nothing to build their confidence or cultivate their interest in the matter .

Some of the descriptions for the attractions go through them , including plot points in 3D movies and so on . The book also leaves a lot out in areas , as dining ( coverage ) , getting around Walt Disney World , and hotels and dining . For me , the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World ( by Bob Sehlinger ) was at giving me the info I needed without giving away any details as to the surprises on the rides . That is , it told me what might frighten a youngster , what might bore an adult , and so on , but it did n't say specifically what would happen at every stage of any of the attractions . Just generalizations about the ride , then warnings for types of people . The things Birnbaum offers that the Unofficial Guide does n't are pictures and info on some of the activities as parasailing . If you have an Internet connection , you do n't need the pictures . And as for the activities as well as maps , you ca n't beat the Passporter book on Disney World . So , for me , the Unofficial Guide plus the Passporter yields the trip planning library for Walt Disney World . If you like , you can also pick up the EZ-Guide , as it also has some maps and info . As for Birnbaum 's , it really does n't have anything to offer . I would n't recommend against buying it , though , except for the `` let me tell you the plot and ending to the movie before you go '' mentality . I hate spoilers , and wish someone had warned me before I started reading this book\", \"Interesting Thesis , but overlooking some points Mr. Friedman 's book begins with an thesis , defining morality and its definition within a context of growth . The idea that growth or stagnation effects the mindsets of the people living in that time period is a argument that Friedman often well supports with facts . However , the exceptions to his argument make me wonder if he really believes in his thesis , or if he just felt the need to write a book . Furthermore , for every chapter in the book , there seem to be at one or arguments or points that , with a thought or research , do n't make sense or can easily be disproven . With these things being the case , I find Friedman 's argument a to buy . The book seems to build up to the chapter , which Friedman uses to make policy recommendations that would aid in growth ; this chapter could have stood alone from the book entirely , however , because the evidence in the book an his arguments elsewhere in the book ( . the importance of education ) do not add or support his policy recommendations . His policy recommendations could have easily been listed by students in an class as responses to the question `` What should the government do to promote growth ? '' They do n't push the argument forward or indicate anything that has n't already been suggested in the past , nor do they give suggestions as to how to go about implementing his policies .\", \"Hardcore Jargon on Intersectional Group For decades , studies scholars have left issues facing non-heterosexuals to the side . For years , `` queer '' scholars have left concerns of people of color to the side . This anthology tries to address that void . It goes a way in proving that , academics can be just a and hardcore as gay ones or ones . The anthology has numbers of men and women . In some ways , it 's a Who 's Who of Black Gay Academia , including works from Cathy Cohen , Dwight McBride , and Jewelle Gomez . Still , there is about this book that frustrated me . A years ago , a study was done of LGBTs and respondents said they hated the term `` queer , '' yet the academics here champion it . Really , if `` queer '' is supposed to represent the four groups equally , then this book was quite lacking in its coverage of bisexuals and the transgendered . This is given writers as Alice Walker , Stuart Hall , and June Jordan . Often `` people of color '' is used when only blacks are brought up ; Latinos , Asians , and Native Americans barely come up in this book at all . James Baldwin is brought up often here . I understand that . His writings were and often dealt with and issues simultaneously . Still , I kept thinking about how hooks once wrote that Toni Morrison gets a lot of attention when publishers wo n't print the works of women that are equally as . James Baldwin deserves his crown in , letters , but I 'm about him being the only one to get to wear a crown . books have been printed about the members of the Harlem Renaissance , yet that group hardly comes up here . James is getting a bit played out and the authors here are not helping change that tendency . Finally , I had beef with of the essays . Charles Nero has points but his essay is really two works glued together . Can anyone really say the whiteness of New Orleans ' `` gay ghetto '' is to `` Chasing Amy '' or `` Feet Under '' ? One author could have written quickly about how he supported a gay , student when that student was condemned by a masculine , one . Instead , he went on and on in jargon and . Kara Keeling 's essay was 90 % theory and 10 % a discussion of Dunye 's `` Watermelon Woman . '' Why bother to bring up the film if you 're barely going to discuss it ?

I know why thousands of murders are to Popop . Without them , while he might justify bombings in his mind , he could hardly do so in company . But I live in Ireland , not America , where news of these murdered thousands has not reached us . Gerry Adams never said a word about them , not wishing to be laughed out of the country . He had to make the all these years of a dozen fellows caught in a crossfire in Derry in 1973 . I guess he saved the one for the boyos in Boston .

I do n't know how someone could travel in countries that extensively and end up completely by the experience . However , this fits perfectly with his arrogance , which is truly the theme of the book . He already knows it all and will tell you all about it .

He 'll `` describe '' one of the mountain chains on earth , the Andes , as `` the top of the world '' ( p. 315 ) for five sentences and then move on to more matters like adventures with border guards and investing . Great writing ? ! I think he used a computer program to come up with his `` descriptions '' of the places he went . Mr. Rogers is woefully about the places he goes - and he does n't learn anything along the way .

Also , there 's to no character development even of `` Mr. Chairman '' , Juan Cabrillo . The fact that he and his companions are mercenaries ( with a penchant for deeds that pay well ) does n't compare favorably with the NUMA heroes .

While even the Hendrix fan knows Jimi was born in King County Hospital , ( Now Harbor View ) Lawrence states he was born at the home of a family friend . ( ) Jimi is quoted allegedly throughout the book but from some tapes of interviews that no one has seen or heard and that Lawrence conveniently plans on destroying so one can profit from cigarette packs ( yes , cigarette packs ) and necklaces are being sold via ebay or to collectors allegedly having belonged to Hendrix , siting Ms. Lawrence as the owner and source of authenticity . At one point she aledgedly quotes Hendrix as saying : '' The LSD passed around San Francisco was a discovery for me , I 'd taken acid in London but ... . '' Aside from Jimi 's use of the word 'fabulous ' being at , the fact that Hendrix had already tried LSD in New York in 1996 before going to England and subsequently Monterey is knowledge among and again makes all of these alledged direct quotes . Those of you who have listened to and read the hundreds of hours of interviews through collectors , releases and press clippings will also find some of the wording of these alledged quotes that the book , and the credibility of it 's author are based on , extremely . At one point Ms. Lawrence even offers an quote from Hendrix 's mother who passed away in 1958 : '' Jimi baby '' she told her son `` I have to escape this '' While quotes like this can illicit an response from the reader , they are clearly . Throughout the book people close to Jimi are referenced but very sparsely quoted , if at all . I shared the recount of Jimi 's trip to Berkeley as a child ( Pg.5 ) with Jimi 's aunt Delores and she laughed openly and wondered aloud where people come up with these stories . This from a woman who was actually there and involved in planning said trip . While making a reference to Ernestine Benson and misstakenly referring to her husband Cornel as `` Bill '' , Lawrence again allegedly quotes Hendrix in lieu of an interview with the Benson 's who are both still living and have hand insights having lived with the Hendrix 's . Lawrence 's assertion that Hendrix committed suicide simply because his journal was left out is no less than Jimi 's adopted stepsister Janie 's claim that Jimi did n't OD . Lawrence then stops just of gleefully giving herself credit for Monika 's suicide , but the jist is . This book is than a bit with Lawrence lauding herself as much as she does her . While proclaiming herself to be a confident of Hendrix ' the consensus is that she was n't around that much , if people even know who she is at all . For a much well researched and look into Jimi 's life read Electric Gypsy or even more so , the book Room Full Of Mirrors by Charles Cross . The Man , The Magic , The Truth , while very , is with glaring inaccuracies and is for the part a novel about the author and her subject , not a biography or a record .

The language is disjointed and as if it were written with the use of a thesaurus . Again this could be forgiven as we 're reading this book for a soldier 's account , not that of an grad student .

'' Whereas Fick seems to be an intelligent , and warrior whose concern is the welfare of his men , Coughlin conveys himself as a intellect with more concern for glory and satisfaction than anything else . He is a team player when he hand picks the team and considers them of his company . You can not know a person from reading their writing but Coughlin 's character development is very . His attempts to convey a `` side '' are and seem grossly contrived . This is a contrast to the character development in `` One Bullet . '' There is no connection between author and reader in `` Shooter . '' Coughlin does not develop the role players either . In `` One Bullet '' you really feel the brotherhood developed among the officer , his NCOs and the enlisted men . Additionally , Coughlin 's descriptions of his support staff ( pullers ) is and reinforces doubts about his team ethic . To make matters the action is n't as well developed as in titles . The author 's tone and emphasis on exploits , with plenty of after-action chest thumping , obscures the view of battle . He spends time on the finer elements of sniper tradecraft , training and shooting . This can be found elsewhere . Overall this book was a disappointment .

Rossi , therefore is being fairly depicted as publishing information within paradigms . On the math side , Rossi mentions Fibonacci 's algorithm and phi , two paradigms that clearly were not used in Egypt , though like to suggest that they were . The Fibonacci algorithm idea was introduced after 1891 and J.J. Sylvester 's views of the RMP 's 2/nth table , are point to 1202 AD and the Liber Abaci , but not a reference point of Egypt . Egypt used more ideas like http : //egyptianmath.blogspot.com and http : //akhmimwoodentablet.blogspot.com . Yet , Hultsch in 1895 clearly showed that Ahmes in 1650 BC easily wrote out 2/p series into and unit fraction series using a very partitioning method ( as Ahmes wrote out answers in his position ' algebra problems , ie . 5/19 written out in a awkward series using 1/12th as the partition , as he did for 2/19 , as describe a couple paragraphs below . Ahmes wrote 5/19 per , 5/19 - 1/12 = ( 60 - 19 ) / ( 12*19 ) = ( 38 + 2 1 ) / ( 12*19 ) or , 5/19 = 1/6 + 1/12 + 1/114 + 1/228 ) . scholars ( two being ) have often suggested that supposition ' was used by Ahmes , hinting that Ahmes guessed at his answers . Ahmes never guessed ! Ahmes' answers were always when he worked with numbers . Moderm scholars were the ones that had guessed , and missed , finding Ahmes methods . Interestingly no scholar , until very recently , has claimed to have read Ahmes ' shorthand notes . Modern scholars had sadly filled gaps left by Ahmes with their guesses - of which have been proven to be ( as Rossi had not learned , since he referenced none of the fraction and weights and measures issues ) . Bruins also discovered the Hultsch method in 1945 , and today the method is named the Hultsch-Bruin method . It says that 2/p = 1/A + ( 2A -p ) /Ap where A , a highly number selected in the range p/2 lt ; A lt ; p with the divisors of A uniquely added to ( 2A -p ) thereby solving ( ) /Ap . Example , 2/19 = 1/12 + ( 24 -19 ) / ( 12*19 ) = 1/12 + ( 3 + 2 ) / ( 12*19 ) = 1/12 1/76 1/114 with the ( 4 + 1 ) alternative being discarded since its denominator was too .

Here also Rossi did not seen the remainder found in RMP # 62 where 100/13 = 7 + 9/13 = 7 + 2/3 1/39 . Generally Ahmes and all scribes divided by this Q = quotient and R = remainder method . The Akhmim Wooden Tablet even shows a method for grain and volume division where a hekat unity 64/64 was divided by n , with lt ; 64 , as ( 64/64 ) /n = Q/64 + R/ ( n*64 ) Even more , Ahmes also used this method to divide 100 hekat by 70 , with his form matching the Akhmim Wooden tablet 's use of ro = 1/320th of a hekat , by : ( 6400/64 ) /70 = 91/64 + 30/ ( 70*64 ) and introducing ro = 1/320 of a hekat , = ( 1 +16 + 8+ 2 1 ) /64 = ( 150/70 ) * 1/320 1+ 1/4 1/8 1/32+ 1/64 + ( 2 + 1/7 ) *ro I 'll not go on and discuss Rossi ' view of architecture being the above her Cambridge comments . Overall , accept Rossi 's view as , and I do as well , in areas . However , on the side of Rossi 's use of a Sylvester 's and techniques , all disproven years ago , shows that her Cambridge training needs to be expanded to read the texts .

'' This most `` '' statement leads the reader to believe that he `` seems '' to know so about genetics and man that he knows all about the Jefferson-Hemings DNA Study and for what `` reason '' he sees to include it into a book as being very suspect as mentioned by some reviewers . He seems to not associate science and truth together as it pertains to the Jefferson-Hemings controversy . Unless I overlooked it , I saw no reference to the work that Spencer Wells is performing for National Geographic Socity . I assisted this study by providing access to Jefferson DNA sources . The result of a match was found in the Phoenicians , ( Caanites mentioned in the bible ) and in lands that today are Syria and Lebanon . From what I know of the study ( I assisted Dr. E.A . Foster with the DNA study ) , Mr. Wade 's analysis of this is extremely , in fact , it is extremely biased . `` Thomas Jefferson fathered an family with his slave mistress Sally Hemings '' ( pg 257 ) . What fact does he have to give this statement ? He makes the most of giving details by lying James Callender and lying Samuel Wetmore/Madison Hemings in Pike Co. , Ohio . Why the details in a book topic as this ? I will give you readers on the DNA topic my opinion . As you may see in my reviews of books , these authors know nothing of the details of the DNA Study but spread biased media tales . He did not inform you that a team of ribbon scholars ( 13 professors ) for the Scholars Commission ( [ ... ] ) and determined that there is no proof that Jefferson is of these charges . You may read on my page : www.angelfire.com/va/TJTruth all the details of this study . He can not plead ignorance of the details because I sent him my research early in the media blitz and any reporter not using the search engines to thoroughly search a subject is most in my opinion . Can any researcher read his book and believe he/she is receaving knowledge . My knowledge of the topics he has written about is , BUT I do know this Jefferson-Hemings Study and he has done no or research . He references Annette Gordon-Reed as some type of `` authority '' on the controversy . She was charged by the Scholars Commission Report as having completely rearranged a letter from Jefferson 's grand-daughter to give a meaning to her words . To add insult to his otherwise attempt to influence your thinking , Wade has a figure with the title , `` Thomas Jefferson Family with Sally Hemings. ( Pg.260-261 ) . '' His lack of knowledge of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson is lacking in research because he goes into details that Martha Jefferson and Sally Hemings are half-sisters ( an rumor brought forward by people wishing to confuse readers and to be politically . He does not mention a very book by Dr. and Mrs. James McMurry , `` Anatomy of a Scandal , Thomas Jefferson and the Sally Story '' , who did research on this rumor and found it a lie designed to fit earlier mud slinging . Since he did not give the reader another source for study , another VERY book , `` Jefferson Vindicated , Falacies , Omissions , and Contradictions in the Hemings Genealogical Search '' , I will tell you it has a foreword by Monticello Director , James A , Bear , Jr. All of the named books , including , `` The Jefferson-Hemings Myth '' are through Amazon . I do agree with Wade 's sentence on the Jefferson-Hemings controversy ... ... . '' Some mysteries lie beyond the power of even DNA to resolve . '' I might add that history is intertwined with DNA and even the Hemings will NOT permit the gathering of `` another '' Hemings DNA source ... ..only ONE originally tested .

It is touted as history , yet not only does it lack any material , it also lacks any facts . than history , quot ; Soul by Soul quot ; seems to be a , tract designed to promote two ideas : 1. that people living in the antebellum South were universally , and cruel and 2. that people living in the antebellum South were universally , and . To support his views , Professor Johnson strings together a collection of snippets from literature and excerpts from litigation proceedings . His contribution is represented by his ability to enter the psyche of the book 's characters and divine their , but , motives and thoughts . Quite a feat for any ! One loses count of the number of times that the reader is treated to people using their quot ; probing fingers quot ; in this book . Fortunately , in between probes , the reader can be shocked by the quot ; killing fields of the South , quot ; the quot ; sexualization of bodies , quot ; the quot ; slaveholders ' failure to live through the bodies of their slaves , quot ; and the quot ; perogatives of whiteness . quot ; This is , stuff worthy of a TV mini-series but it is out of place in a supposedly history text . I live in a quarter in New Orleans . In the antebellum period , this building and its resident slaves were , interestingly enough , owned by a who was financially ruined in 1863 by the Emancipation Proclamation . As an amateur historian , I would have thought that a book about the New Orleans slave market would contain some facts about these markets . What were their addresses ? What percentage of their customers were ? What percentage were ? How slaves did the New Orleans household have ? How were they fed and clothed ? What were their working hours ? These are questions that should have been addressed but instead , the reader is given an emotionally charged , , rehash of , previously published material . In , this book , for the part , reads like a rambling , overly long . Anyone seeking scholarship on the subject of slavery would do well to look elsewhere and should consider reading the quot ; Slave Narratives quot ; compiled by the Federal Writers Project , quot ; Time on the Cross quot ; by Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman and quot ; The Slave Trade quot ; by Hugh Thomas . The of these is a collection of interviews of slaves performed by the W.P.A . in the 1930 's .

Sadly Ben Alba 's `` Inventing Night : Steve Allen and the Original `` Tonight Show '' , is not that book . It is , largely , a poorly edited and pastiche of previously published memoirs by Allen himself combined with some interviews with Allen 's TV contemporaries . These interviews could form the basis of an book by the likes of biographers Scott Berg ( Sam Goldwin ) or Neal Gabler ( Walter Winchle ) . The opening chapter , which addresses Allen 's , education and his days in radio and TV sets the stage for the author 's failure to create a , portrait of Allen and his work . Alba draws here , almost exclusively and certainly uncritically , from Allen 's memiors while combining these words with one quote from a childhood friend and two reviews . Taking Allen and the reader 's one witness at face value , Allen had a rootless , violent and childhood . Given these conditions Alba gives no hint of how , why or even if , Allen really remained attached to his drunken and generally mother and her equally extended family . The author gives us two stories from Allen 's adulthood to demonstarte that the family ties endured . Actually , all the stories show is that Allen attended an uncle 's and very briefly troted his mother out once on his Sunday night show . How did this world of Allen 's youth effect his two marriages and five sons ? Why , after a childhood on the fringes of a show business existance did Allen choose this career field for himself ? Alba does n't even pose questions about the boy 's effects on the man . He just plows ahead in a haze . Throughout `` Inventing ... '' Alba maintains this pattern of unquestioning acceptance Allen 's words . No witnesses are called , no points of view are examined . Steve tells a story ; Alba accepts it and edits it into his text . Why not read Allen straight ?\", \"A Review As Ugly As This Novel It truly is the war fiction regarding WWII if you have never read ANY fiction regarding WWII . I love war fiction and non-fiction and beside parroting the Time Magazine blurb prominently displayed in the novel I can not even come close to understanding why anyone , let alone review after review , would even come close to that stupefying conclusion . To me it is the example of snobbery that critics like to pat themselves on the back with . Only they understand and you intellects are not of appreciating . What it is , is a , , waste of time . Of course any piece of literature is , but to me , this critically work fails on every level that a novel should , regardless of genre . Unless you love James Joyce ( another writer lorded over us by the critically ) , I think readers expect some sort of plot development . Do n't expect that here . How about engaging characters that develop and grow throughout the novel ? You pick up something else . It seems to me the reader should at be invested in one of the character 's outcome . Far too a thought if you `` get '' this art . If I ca n't have any of that how about writing a character that is even remotely ? Forget it leaguer ! I was rooting for the Japanese to kill them all , so at their `` loved '' ones at home would be spared of these nearly universally beings . The thing that propelled me to finish was to get to the ending that would perhaps tie together the experience of reading these soldier 's ruminations while , oh by the way , a war was being fought around them . Nope , no ending either . It just ends . Yes , I have heard that the plodding ugliness and pointlessness of the book is to symbolize war itself . Give me a break .

So I have to be very not to copy the Left when I write as a generation Kansan and having lived all of my life , thus far , in the `` class '' suburb Mr. Frank seems to so despise in his and book . But his book was so filled with errors , opinions disguised as facts and mislabeling of events , people and culture , as to make it a book of fiction ; not one of fact . He stated himself he had every advantage presented to him early in life but he chose not to take advantage of them . He relishes being a victim and seems to mostly be upset that he was n't born into a family of laborers . Perhaps born as Ms. Condoleezza Rice ? She is certainly a example of someone held down by conservatives and not permitted to excel in life ( not ) . Living in , and exposed to , the surroundings of his childhood , it appears to me his life 's goal was to become a victim and a loser in life where the deck is stacked against you from birth . He 's , so far , at succeeding in that ! Being an accomplished loser . What a goal ! His `` accomplishment '' was the writing of one book that could only be believed as fact by disciples of The DailyKOS . Having written his book of what life is NOT like in Johnson County , Kansas and how he was stopped cold at every turn of life 's lottery , he really has nothing else to say . Perhaps he can now survive as an invention of the Left writing the type of fiction over and over ( as he just did for the NY Times ) . He must be a very person . It seems liberals are . How . The obstacle they have in life is seen in their mirror each morning . That 's it no matter how much they deny reality . He seems like an man who had everything going for him . What a waste of talent . Now , he 's just another `` victim '' doing his to convince everyone else they too should just give up as they ca n't win in life no matter how hard they try . As I intimated , I 'm Condoleezza Rice ignored people like him ! I just people like him were in number and that ignored their vision of reality .

Despite it 's 320 pages , this could have been printed in 150 , and contained much the material . The thing that redeems this novel from being totally is the snatches of Latin and Old English ballads scattered throughout .

It 's also about a boy who loses his father , and has to search for him , in the company of a being , but has ten times the depth and realism of this piece of trash . The boy is also a minstrel , of sorts , but he has more qualities than Adam , as well as adventures in pages .

Well in my opinion , there is no longer any doubt that some things appear to be flying in our skies , and some people have had some experiences ( mostly disturbing , but some apparrently enlightening ) , but the question is , is it all as it seems ? The fact of the matter is , branches from around the globe have hardware that could easily fool us . projections can and are used to place images within our skys ( this is related to theories surrounding the 911 events ) ; there are devices that can manipulate brain waves and excitation to have people hallucinate any scenario ; , drug manipulated techniques can control memories and behaviour ; implants have been around for decades and have even gone mainstream now ( Verichip ) . I 'm not saying that lifeforms do n't exist in the Universe ( far from it ) , and perhaps there are a number of entities here on Earth carrying out agendas , but this idea that there are , menacing Greys abducting us for sinister reasons without COLLUSION seems . It smells of fear mongering that the love to push on us . Historically , there 's been the Barbarians , Huns , Mongols , Pagans , Jews , Christians , Vikings , Natives , Cannabals , Natives , Mexicans , Germans , Nazis , Communists , now the Arabs and the conclusion is some force off planet because they have used all the men on Earth . Even President Reagan set us up for this scenario in an speech in the 80 's . The fact is that with technology ( not including whatever they may have that has not been leaked ) , they could quite easily pull the hoax off . Even manipulation and cloning is much further and PRACTICED ( albeit `` '' ) than people can fathom . What has become another fact is the extent to which the UFO community has been infiltrated and compromised , of which Strieber has been and centre at times . My belief is that Strieber is part of this fear mongering campaign , sponsored by the elite and carried out by and government groups . In this book , his `` hard-evidence '' is and . For example , why would n't super Aliens using implants design them that they are entirely and of shapes that tissue ( thus not showing up on any , MRI , CT , etc ) ? And design them that they quickly break down when removed from the body ? Surely , this would be child 's play for Alien scientists ? Why no discussion or mention of the , or NAZI connection with abductions ? There seems to be a growing number of victims who are recalling `` fragments '' of memories that are slipping through memory covers . Why are they mentioning cooperation of doctors and nurses with the Greys ? Why are they mentioning swastikas and known insignias on uniforms ? Why are some speaking English , others ? Why is there a connection with , bases and specifically Antartica ? These are things Strieber never mentions , which I find . My point is , things are happening , but it has become nearly to ascertain what , and Strieber 's books seem to cloud the issues and possibly even advance agendas .\", \"3.64 lbs of Pure Spirtual Abuse John R.

There are far , far communications engineers out there than John R. Barry [ infinitely better to be ] . And what makes these others better others meaning engineers ; John R. Barry being a `` engineer '' ] is not ability , memorized knowledge , or even shrewdness , but rather the difference lies in a faith of facts ; something a follower of Proakis never seems to possess or even grasp the possibility . In fact , the values and beliefs in the Proakis text seem to promulgate not only Abuse , but also a sort as well . In a nation ( where Steven Pinker , who like Proakis is of Harvard Fame , has noted ) that has around 75 % of its population esentially believing in the account of things , this kind of abuse can be very indeed and lead to consequences . Though it may not be , nevertheless , the values and beliefs of Proakis 's text and those of its instructors tend to be extremely spiritually . These values and these beliefs somehow set up a cognative dissonance with student 's values and beliefs . The result is almost always a broken-spirit . From an perspective , this is . Very .

First let me state that Chalmers Johnson , this book notwithstanding , is not by profession the village diot . Johnson is a highly respected and analyst , a man who used to be listening to . What happened ? How did he come to cobble together this breathtakingly smorgasborg ? Where did the imperialist conspiracy come from ? Johnson , where did you go ? Well , the answer is that he delves into areas of which he has no knowledge . His take on America 's policies is . Anyone who questions why the U.S. Army is still in Korea after 50+ years need only point to Seoul on a map and drag his finger a couple of inches north , where he will discover NORTH KOREA .

Brushing aside the fact that of the authors of the group are ageing oddballs from the 60s ( you underestimate the effect of that era at your peril ) , the reason for these immensely , books is this : no one fully understands globalization .

Reality This book is inexplicably , probably to its catchy but ultimately title . Barber fails to convincingly analyze an thesis , instead delivering an exasperating 300 list of every thing on Earth that he disagrees with . Barber contends that behavior results in and enclaves trying to separate themselves from the world , while capitalism is erasing flavor with mass-culture sameness . Interestingly , Barber contends that these two movements are actually in an alliance , using each 's excesses as excuses for their behavior . That is a thesis , which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating . The part of the book is an tirade of lists within lists , of trends that Barber disdains , in an avalanche of complaints that is not but merely and . It 's all tied together with attempts at `` '' pop culture references , terminology ( like the annoying `` telesector '' ) , and quotations and namedropping . All is lumped together unconvincingly under the term `` McWorld , '' which is so and as to become meaningless . In his examples of how trends are damaging the freedom and intelligence of the masses , Barber merely comes across as a condescending snob who thinks his interests are , or a curmudgeon who thinks everything was back in the days , or both . In the part of the book , Barber proceeds to throw obtuse science theories at world hotspots , in which tribalism and separatism are damaging the integrity of nation-states . His term for this phenomenon is the dangerously term `` Jihad . '' Note that this book was published back in 1995 , so that word was not as prevalent in discourse as it is now , but Barber still uses the term as a descriptor which is to offend both devout Muslims and anti-Islamists . When it comes to the specifics , reviews here and elsewhere list out the flaws in Barber 's arguments , and there are so of them that a lot of reviews are for the task . You can agree or disagree with critiques of Barber 's contentions based on your politics . But everyone will probably conclude that in this book 's section he does not deliver on the implications of his initially thesis ( embodied in the book 's title ) , and simply forwards borrowed theories on society and the sector . , this book is mostly the grumblings of a know-it-all who portentously predicts doom for every and reality of the world . ~doomsdayer520~\", \"Do n't fail to read this if you 're to Earth In today 's world , forms of parochialism have a relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism .

OK , I 'm not saying a novel must contain no anachronisms whatsoever ( it IS fiction , after all ) , but really , glaring mistakes of geography or history can not be tolerated .

'' When I picked up this book , I expected to read a truly tale about how people got with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with . What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of presumption . The book starts out promisingly , even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose . We 're given the account of Charles Monet , one of the cases of the Ebola virus . From there on , Preston gives a description of the virus , what it does , how it does it - the works . Then , he moves on to the Human Component , the cast of characters , so to speak , for the story . The story is , alas , not so . It 's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause problems to come about , but nothing of the sort happens . Basically , people run around in gear , fret a lot , and monkeys die . In between , Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about cases of the Ebola virus , cases of people being infected , `` crashing and bleeding out , '' cases that are a lot more than a shipment of monkeys , unless you 're a PETA type . The thing about The Hot Zone is just how Preston is . He starts to novelize his subjects a chapters into the book , which is a idea , but not when they do n't die at the end . Basically , he 's trying to make you care about these people , and all for naught . And by the time that you 're supposed to be truly , you actually WANT them to die , because you 're tired of hearing about him describe , in detail , what they eat in the morning , what they do in the afternoon , and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night . When you 're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus , why are you time talking about Nancy Jaax 's hands and karate prowess ? Moreover , when you 've finally gotten to the monkeys , why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the ? Does anyone really care ? I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways than to reverse my peristalsis , but I ca n't . Preston 's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are and ; he had the chance to write a thriller about an crisis of proportions , but he instead chose to `` get into the minds '' of his subjects . And what a bore that became . There were only two redeeming aspects of this book : one was the description of the African , Ebola victims , and the was the description of the virus itself , although , again , both were sabotaged by Preston 's inability to write . If you want to know something about Ebola , go get An Idiot 's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics . If you 're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element , read The Hot Zone .

Yes , it contains a kernel of truth , but it ultimately is if not balanced by a diet of thinkers and theologians as Thomas Merton , St. Francis of Assisi , Ron Sider , Tony Campolo , Brian McLaren , Brother Lawrence , Philip Yancey , Wendell Berry-the list goes on . It often is of oversimplifying the conflicts the Church faces , drawing the lines down to `` Christians '' against the `` naturalists '' or `` humanists , '' thus ignoring the range of threats that seek to destroy the Church . While there is truth in Colson 's writing , I believe it ultimately stems from a flawed worldview-one defined largely by thought and nationalism , sprinkled with the politically amount of belief . His faith seems to be overly , one that favors rhetoric and proof over prayer and disciplines . Evangelism , it seems to Colson , is comprised heavily of apologetics . The secularists must be shown that they are , he says . Yes , there is truth and there is time for debate , but this book seems to prefer winning debates over building bridges and relationships . You see , I used to fear evolutionists and the round table of `` humanists '' that evangelicals love to discuss . But as I 've grown , I realize that threats to the Church come more often from within than from culture , and they almost always have to do with power and politics than the Enlightenment or science .\", \"I AM I DID PAY FOR THIS BOOK !

Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait , a very , very hook . With ease , this lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in trouble . Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him , he immediately loses sight of reality . What a hollow and individual he is , as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world . Whether or not there are individuals ( Enron ? ) is beside the point . They may exist , but I for one am not to hear their life stories . The atmosphere in which they live is , as are their conversations , their lack of values , their hobbies , their sex lives , and their comeuppances .

Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel , which is , but he ends up putting the message above the story . Grisham devotes much of this novel to a plaintiffs ' lawyer and his law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits . This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain , in agonizing detail , how tort lawyers sue companies and collect fees . Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the wealth of class action lawyers , and how they put their greed above the interests of their clients . In the end , none of this adds up to an storyline . It does n't help that the lawyer in this novel is a rather person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall . Since I did n't care for this character , I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely . This novel is also rather and in tone . I personally dislike class action lawsuits , but I read novels for entertainment , not to validate my beliefs .

This is the Nevada Barr that I have read . I picked it up on the strength of Deep South , which I thought was really . It was frustrating that nearly all of what I liked about Deep South was missing from Flashback .

The war story ( told through letters and sequences ) is clearly intended to add a note of mystery to the story . Some may like the flavor that this element provides , but for me it dilutes the elements of the writing that I most enjoy . I really liked the realism of Deep South , and felt that the style put it a cut above books in the genre . Flashback , on the hand , felt painfully contrived . The plot line with the letters was extremely and ( to my mind ) . If you like mysteries with a flavor than you like realism in a novel , then you will probably be significantly less than I was by Flashback . Barr at made a choice with her approach to the book .

A Completely Mediocre Read If HZ 's title gives you pause , you 're on to something . The `` story '' Preston narrates is , indeed , terrifying . It is a story about disease , politics , epidemiology , history , geography ... So much could have been made of this story ( and so has been , by far more writers ) . Preston , it seems , is only of going for the jugular . HZ shows no evidence of research ( it lacks even a trace of a bibliography ) , and attests little than a grasp , on the part of its author , of the history , epidemiology , or politics of Ebola ( no than one might glean from any article on the topic ) . From its opening page stroll through the doors of a research lab , to its closing page 'death-defying ' romp through Kitum Cave ( how very brave of you , RP ! ) , HZ is in mode . If this book was not a thinly Hollywood screenplay , I 'll eat my hat . Even this might have been were Preston a remotely observer or a marginally writer . HZ is all cliches and reporting .

So , there were than just five million Christians . There are now approximately only a thousand Christians in Modern Turkey . The question that the author pointedly neglects to address is what happened to the difference between over five million in the 1900s and only a thousand people today . We know that over a million surviving Greeks were expelled in the exhange of populations between Greece and Turkey in 1923 . Again , what happened to the difference of million people ? To the 1.5 million Armenians , must be added three quarters to a million Assyriac Christians ( Arab Christians ) and as as two million Greeks ( almost 30 percent of the people ) . The author does not touch on the numbers of Christians who were enslaved by Turks or forced to convert to Islam to avoid massacre which explains the number Greek-speaking `` Turks '' around Trebizon on the Black Sea . It is not as if there is not accounts of and observers of this genocide and cleansing of the , populations of Anatolia . I can only conclude that the author had such an bias in favor of Turkey as to ignore a slaugher that approaches the holocaust of WWII . Avoiding this amounts to holocaust denial . The genocide was the genocide of the century and Hitler 's model for the genocide . The massacre of the Greek and population of Smyrna ( now Izmir ) ranks with the Rape of Nanking in sheer horror and scale , but the author skips over it in a rush to avoid any detail of the crime or assign any blame except to the Greeks and Armenians by repeating the discredited canard that they set fire to their city . The author 's treatment of the Christian genocide reminds me of the comments to me of a officer at a NATO conference which were to the effect that there had been no genocide ( the Government official line ) but , in any case , that they had deserved it . The author seems to have taken her treatment of the subject from the Government as well\", \"BAH ! Correction Please '' Karl Marx , years ago , gave a description of why this might be happening . He followed the most and theory for wealth and value : an object is as as the effort it takes to make . '' NO IT 'S NOT ! ! ! An object 's worth is based upon both the supply of an object and the demand for it arrising from consumers . To imply that it comes from the effort it takes to make implies that a milkshake that takes only a minutes to make is far than a vial of poison that took an hour to make or an bomb that took months to make , which would mean that we should subsidize the complex , since all those workers worked to create those things . `` Petty-bourgeois ' owners , i.e . the stores and business in , of which my grandpa , a dentist , was a part of , are being driven under by chain competition in retail . '' This is either to the innefficiency in their store to meet consumer demands or to the regulations burdened upon them by the government . All regulations do nothing but add an increased burden on to competition and thus kills them out . There 's a reason why the owner 's of Wal-Mart recently said that the government should increase the wage to over $ 8 , as this would cause businesses to go , lay off employees , and future businesses from starting up to compete with Wal-Mart . Another problem is the subsidies that the store pays to Wal-Mart ( Wal-Mart collects millions in subsidies to Marx 's Labor Theory of Value once again ) and of the use of emminent domain abuse ( which can be justified on the grounds of the `` '' as opposed to the good of your mom and pop stores ) . `` But no theory is ever , and socialists should be to correct their flaws to account for nature and `` reality . '' There is no reason to believe that hierarchy and class division is a evil ; workers CAN manage their lives just fine through cooperatives . '' there is . beings are inherently , differing in skills , abilities , ambition , the choices that they make in life , how they apply their time , etc . etc . Of course , there is is n't any reason that individuals ca n't create wealth nonetheless , creating goods and services that help others out in exchange for some or service itself . And cooperatives need to be . Nor can cooperatives produce the bulk of wealth . There needs to be some Division of Labor , Trade and Commerce , etc . or else all cooperatives end up as hunter-gatherering tribes reduced to the law of the jungle to survive . This ca n't happen if everything is collectively owned . `` Since workers are the producers of goods from scratch to end '' NO ! Entreprenuers , innovators , etc . provide much of the creativity , design , direction for the purchase and use of capital goods , negotiation of deals , evaluation of threats , problems , and consumer requests , and things . It was n't the workers at Microsoft who created cheap computers , it was Bill Gates , the workers are merely a form of mass-production who help out , but ultimately produce a or service in exchange for privately owned wages , caused by supply and demand .\", \"The title of the book tells all . Pick up any king from the world and read any writing about him by one of his blind followers , whose very existence and relevance is to that king . What you will get from that kind of writing ? Noonan was a speechwriter Reagan administration . Sound ? Noonan does not get how citizens used to live under the rule of kings and how they felt about kings . Probably she does not care . Americans are that they never had any king . Noonan fails to provide any information how Reagan dealt with things of his presidency - AIDS , Iran-Contra , welfare , deficits , funding mujahideens , cozy relationship with Saddam . Instead she tried to portray his 8 years like a Disney feelgood fairytale - ruler , citizens ... '' happily lived ever after '' . Basically , this book contains just glorification of a person who is viewed as king by the writer . Her admiration took away her ability of criticism and desire to provide any information that readers do n't know already . This is a writing isolated from the reality of 80 's ( which is nothing in civilizations ) . Secondly , she fails to understand that Reagan was just an politician and have contributions on whatever achieved in his 8 years of presidency - including Americans . But she gives ALL the credits to Reagan , except all the things , like Iran-Contra . In the world of democracy this book deserved to be in - a place for the kings , characters of kings and the writings about them\", \"Extremely , could n't even finish it .

The King Arthur stories read like little than a description of events ; one does n't really get a feeling of being there while things are happening as in `` Robin Hood .

Eddie 's dreams are represented in his niece , Catherine ; and unlike Willy Loman 's uncle , she is still an dream . That makes Eddie 's life seem all the more , in comparison to Willy 's : he longs wearily not after what he could have had , but after what he can never have , as he is already married .

It has everything to do with his lack of insight . That Paul Clemens could live in a city and have such a view of it is . I read the book , waiting for Paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them . But after 241 pages he was no more than he was on page one .

This book reads like the blog of some person who ignores evidence to the and embraces anything that agrees with him . It was very to take seriously', \"PAIN AS GOD 'S MEGAPHONE Since God is Infinite Goodness , we must conclude that the appearance of divine cruelty is a delusion . When we are , we are too to realize that we need God . Since God knows that He is the thing that we really need , He inflicts pain upon us to wake us up to this fact . So is God 's megaphone . If some people , as the Jews , try to love God without going through Christ , it is not yet God - merely the approximation their fantasy can attain . Hence God is forced to keep screeching at them through His megaphone . But even people who try their to love the God , as Job , or C. S. Lewis for that matter , can not adore God as much as He wants to be adored , so He uses pain over and over again to `` plant the flag of truth within their souls . '' Where does this notion of an Infinitely Good God come from ? Given mankind 's existence , `` an inference from the course of events in this world to the Goodness and Wisdom of the Creator would be . '' God had to reveal Himself to mankind by Revelation ; thus it is in the likes of Abraham and Moses , who identified God as , that all peoples are blessed . Lewis informs us that God expostulated with His creatures on the basis of their conceptions - `` What iniquity have your fathers found in me , that they are gone far from me ? '' One has to wonder if Lewis has ever actually read the Bible . Can anyone really deny that if a leader of today did exactly the sorts of things that Abraham and Moses did that they would be decried by all of sane mankind as monsters ? I have never understood why , or how , I am supposed to pretend that this is not . Of course , God is than me , so if I could only see it from God 's viewpoint , I would see that the butchery of populations , including babies and animals , was actually an act of love . In MERE CHRISTIANITY Lewis condemns this line of reasoning in religions as `` nonsense . '' Undoubtedly , we get the impression of a just and loving God through the teachings of Christ , but the conviction that God is Infinite Goodness , Omniscience , and Omnipotence did not come from revelation ; it was developed by philosophers by reasoning through extrapolation -- a process that Lewis , rather inexplicably , deems . Lewis 's insistence that people have will needs to be examined . Even as he describes it , since we are born in sin , we can not use will to avoid sin , and people are blind to their sin . Hence , it logically follows that there can be no will without the ability of self-perception . The evidence suggests that incessant pain , especially when inflicted upon children , destroys this ability . children typically grow up to be abusers . In my case , I adamantly insist it was the drug , marijuana , which first gave me ability , at the age of 23 . Prior to that moment , God knows that I had no will . Free will is not a realized trait that we are born with , but a ability that requires a deal of effort to develop . In people it remains largely . Since will is on self-knowledge , the role of religion needs to be the development of ability . adherence can only hinder this . Lewis is at enough to acknowledge evolution . Unfortunately , it is hardly to reconcile the notion of evolution of man from animals with his notion that animals only by destroying each because they were corrupted by Satan before man 's appearance on Earth . Somehow , the perfectly `` Paradisal Man '' descended from animals already corrupted by Satan . Lewis can be abominably silly sometimes . Lewis is given to disjunctive , either/or , logic . Either the experience of awe is a twist in the mind with no purpose , or it is experience of the - a Revelation . I would once have scoffed at this , but a vision of Christ was the turning point of my life . The problem is that this Revelation was not at all with Mere Christianity . According to Lewis , the purpose of pain is to break our will , since it is our wills that keep us from God . I had only recently come to realize that I had not had will until my sense of self was awakened by an drug . I experienced Christ in the very moment that I was cursing Christ for demanding that I beg forgiveness for that which He was . Albeit , at the time I was an atheist , and was only cursing at what I had been taught about Christ . I experienced Christ as the core of my being , not as an entity completely from myself , and as an awakening of will , not a surrender . Lewis assures me that the feeling of being one with God , rather than a creature of God , is Satan 's deception . But I have also experienced Satan within myself . If Christ were not the core of my being , I would never have survived Satan . I know the difference . I do not acknowledge that Christianity has the authority tell me what my experience of God must be . I am a scientist by training , not given to credulity , however much like it what I have written above must sound . In my attempt to make sense of my experience of Christ and Satan battling within my mind , I have come up with the myth : It is , at , not completely to assume that consciousness is an quality of existence . This consciousness would first be in a state , probably in some way for evolution , though not by anything like design by control . There could be no distinction between and ; in fact the terms could have no meaning , until evolved to a complexity of self-awareness . As developed , so did awareness of pain and terror , and a rebellion against achieving a level of awareness of experiencing pain . The mind , as the vessel of consciousness experiences these trends and , for whatever reason , tends to personify them as God and Satan , or their equivalents . What makes the Christian God so is His refusal to accept responsibility for anything . Satan can therefore be described as `` God 's self-ignorance . '' Buddhists are apparently to put themselves into the state of inanimate matter , hence there insistence that and evil are . C. S. Lewis tells us that `` it is not God 's purpose that we should go back into that identity . '' I think I agree with him on this point . Mankind 's goal must be to attain will be becoming of what we really are . ( Peter Payne , author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA : A YOUNG MAN 'S ENCOUNTER WITH THE EVIL WITHIN HIMSELF )\", \"than ! !

Another disappointment is Koontz 's recycling of elements from novels : ( 1 ) plucky , highly disabled girl ( the protagonist in `` The Hideaway '' had almost deformities and personality ) , ( 2 ) devoted , canine companions , ( 3 ) guys driving around in pimped-out RVs , and ( 4 ) evil bioethicists . The Leilani character is patently . She conveniently has a genius IQ , but that does not make the absurdly manner in which she speaks any more . I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot . Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children , and this book is no exception . Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds ; the latter , however , does not justify his habit of making children talk like genius adults . Dean heaps the hardships on Leilani , with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker , Texas Ranger . In case you miss the anvils , you are supposed to really , really like her and fear for her safety . I do n't know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics , but he has a terribly view of the field , taking an sect of it to represent the viewpoint of the field . Further , he states times that these bioethics principles are being taught to students at universities ( who will have to pay for their involvement with bioethics ) -- as a student , I can assure you that this is patently . That Koontz could be so on a topic that directly relates to the motive is disconcerting and makes an already book even harder to swallow . The issue is Koontz 's near-deification of dogs , particularly Retrievers , which is a motif in his works . It is and unintentionally to an almost degree . His obsession with dogs and their powers borders on the ( and I like dogs ) . This novel probably features the most example of Koontz 's tendency to create overly , endings .

But I was disappointed to see that Mr. Jeffers failed to fully research this book - the role the Sitka rescue teams played ( both on the Williamsburgh and trying to assess/fight the fire on the Prinsendam ) was totally - despite the fact that there is a lot of documentation that tells our story - which was the side had some quite moments in the face of this event . I was so looking forward to this book and then to find out he left a part of the story out , was very . At we all have our commendations from both the Coast Guard commendant and the Canadian armed services - they knew we were there ! Too Mr. Jeffers did n't diligence .\", \"Highly Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller . Not . In his 1960 introduction to Tropic of Cancer , Karl Shapiro said , `` I call Henry Miller the living author because I think he is , '' `` . . . as a example he stands among the men of our age , '' and `` . . . he [ Orwell ] predicts that Miller will set the pace and attitude for the novelist of the future . This has not happened yet , but I agree that it must . '' Shapiro does not support any of these points in his essay , and nothing about Tropic of Cancer supports them , either . Tropic of Cancer consists of 318 pages recounting Miller 's experience as an expatriate in Paris and expounding his philosophy , often in ways that are rambling and painfully . Miller 's stories about his friends are , pointless , and catty ; like Miller , they seem to have been hacks whose belief in their abilities makes them artists and writers , as though believing is being . Miller writes , `` A year ago , six months ago , I thought I was an artist . I no longer think about it , I am '' -- which is the type of pretentiousness he mocks in virtually all of his acquaintances . When they are not creating , or talking about philosophy or creating , Miller and his circle seem to spend nearly every moment picking up women ( and disease ) . They rarely use a term as `` woman '' when there are so obscene , demeaning words with which to objectify the gender . The women that Miller and friends find are invariably portrayed as , , , , sly , , and primarily for one function , which Miller turns into a , , act . In spite of all the vice and the `` living , '' no one seems to be having fun , and some characters , notably Fillmore , find themselves nearly trapped into the life . Miller expresses contempt for the machine , the age , and money -- although he schemes to keep 2,800 francs from Fillmore 's mistress and revels in having so in his pocket . Often , Miller obsesses about food and relies on his friends to support him . When he describes his friend Kepi as `` . . . a scrounger , a sort of tick who fastens himself to the hide of even the compatriot , '' he could be talking about himself as he bitterly complains about those of his friends who are with money , accommodations , food , and wine . Miller 's logic about the world is ; he writes , `` If you want , you 've got to get in harness , get in lockstep . '' On the surface , this is , but it never seems to occur to him that , if you want , someone must cultivate , raise , and the wheat and produce the components ; someone must transform these components into bread ; and someone must deliver it to the shops and cafes . In words , if people were n't in `` step , '' Miller could choose to starve or set himself to produce bread , joining the world in harness . He makes his choice clear , then whines about it . He may despise those who support him , whether they are friends or workers , but that is perhaps because he , a misanthrope who finds fault with everyone but himself , needs the very people he denigrates ( including `` the grocer , the baker , the shoemaker , the butcher , etc. -- all clodhoppers '' ) , a reliance which he resents . He hates the machine and the machine mind , but offers no alternatives . Seemingly of feeling , Miller finds emotion amusing . When a friend says , `` A boy can break your heart . . . He 's so beautiful ! And so ! '' Miller writes , `` We had to laugh at this . It sounded . But Collins was in earnest . '' When an acquaintance to whom he owes money dies , he writes , `` At any rate , he was killed in an automobile accident shortly after my arrival , a circumstance which left me francs to the . '' Shapiro claims that Miller is a poet , but his attempts at and ramblings often make if any sense . Speaking of buildings and statues , Miller says , `` . . . they must be saturated with my anguish , '' the kind of metaphor in which he frequently indulges . He describes artists as himself as the `` ones . '' `` I am ! I say it with a mad , hallucinated grin , and I will keep on saying it though it rain crocodiles . Behind my words are all those grinning , leering , skulking skulls , some and grinning a time , some grinning as if they had lockjaw , some grinning with the grimace of a grin , the foretaste and aftermath of what is always going on . '' Whenever these attempts at philosophy appeared , rambling on for pages , I found myself yearning for a return to his stories about prostitutes , disease , friends , and hunger . Tropic of Cancer is perhaps the book I have ever read ( and I did promise myself that I would read Tropic of Capricorn ) . Shapiro says , `` There are not of these beings left in our world [ emancipated from what ? -- DLS ] , these clowns and clairvoyants , celebrants of the soul and of the and of the promise of America . '' If Miller , with his whining , his criticism , his attitude , his `` art , '' his view of people , and his obsession with excrement , is the `` '' of these souls , may I never meet the . Note : If there were a 0 stars option , Tropic of Cancer would have earned it\", 'I would have put 0 stars This book was a waste . It was boring to read and hard to follow . I finished the book just see how it ended and hoping to clear up the confusion . I never should have read past the chapter . Read Pop Goes the Weasle , or Lake House by Patterson . Just not this book . It is to believe it is written by the author', \"Disturbing novel about being above law Have you ever done something but justified it so that you would n't feel ? Have you ever seen someone else do the thing and condemn him ? In this story , the character seems to believe that even when he does things he 's still a `` guy '' because `` guys '' do n't do things . Dizzing , huh ? Throughout the novel , you review his year of school with him . It starts out with the story of how he got the nickname `` Killer '' to why it 's for him to take drugs or break a statue . The flashbacks of the year are woven within the day drama of him trying to convince a and woman that he did n't rape her . He wo n't let her leave the room until she believes it . The ending is than satisfactory for me . I would much rather the character have received retribution and the girl justice\", \"Meh Jesus , talk about the girl crying `` wolf . '' When I picked up this book , I expected to read a truly tale about how people got with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with . What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of presumption . The book starts out promisingly , even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose . We 're given the account of Charles Monet , one of the cases of the Ebola virus . From there on , Preston gives a description of the virus , what it does , how it does it - the works . Then , he moves on to the Human Component , the cast of characters , so to speak , for the story . The story is , alas , not so . It 's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause problems to come about , but nothing of the sort happens . Basically , people run around in gear , fret a lot , and monkeys die . In between , Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about cases of the Ebola virus , cases of people being infected , `` crashing and bleeding out , '' cases that are a lot more than a shipment of monkeys , unless you 're a PETA type . The thing about The Hot Zone is just how Preston is . He starts to novelize his subjects a chapters into the book , which is a idea , but not when they do n't die at the end . Basically , he 's trying to make you care about these people , and all for naught . And by the time that you 're supposed to be truly , you actually WANT them to die , because you 're tired of hearing about him describe , in detail , what they eat in the morning , what they do in the afternoon , and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night . When you 're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus , why are you time talking about Nancy Jaax 's hands and karate prowess ? Moreover , when you 've finally gotten to the monkeys , why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the ? Does anyone really care ? I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways than to reverse my peristalsis , but I ca n't . Preston 's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are and ; he had the chance to write a thriller about an crisis of proportions , but he instead chose to `` get into the minds '' of his subjects . And what a bore that became . There were only two redeeming aspects of this book : one was the description of the African , Ebola victims , and the was the description of the virus itself , although , again , both were sabotaged by Preston 's inability to write . If you want to know something about Ebola , go get An Idiot 's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics . If you 're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element , read The Hot Zone . Personally , I like to avoid rereading the Uncle Tom 's Cabins of accounting\", 'Only For Those With Little or No Work Experience This book was advertised as though it would be for any . This is absolutely not the case . This book covers very , very guidelines and does so in an overview type fashion .

As a proponent of parenting and a rather unschooler , this book was a BIG disappointment ! ! ! I bought this book after reading the reviews and I had n't paid than $ 1 for it . While the title `` The Child '' accurately describes Laurie 's upbringing , this book should n't be grouped with literature . The author , while cherishing the bond she has with her daughter , reminds me of the mother in `` Love You Forever '' who sneaks across town and climbs into her son 's room at night to spend time with him -- sweet but a bit creepy . The fact that she admits that she even went to college at the time as her daughter so she could spend time with Laurie pretty much says it all . The mother clearly has her issues that I hope she allows herself to work through and heal from now that she 's not spending 24/7 with her child . We have been unschooling each of our four children since birth -- temperments and all -- and I feel very privileged to spend so time with them as they discover how it is to decode and discover the world around them . If you want to read a book about unschooling without platitudes and preaching in almost every chapter , I would recommend `` Homeschooling our Children , Unschooling Ourselves '' .

In Lucy , the title character comes to America to be an nanny for a couple with four daughters . Lucy watches as their marriage crumbles and tries to avoid turning into her mother , who for some reason she hates . I wish we knew a bit more about Lucy , like why she hated her homeland so much .

She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into . Not reads , but very with lots of character development . I do n't always feel very motivated to get through some of those chapters , but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a ending . Christie was at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the quot ; who , where and why quot ; were finally revealed in the end . I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I did n't know who the killer was , but actually because I already knew who and how . I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too . Very .

I remember seeing the art and hearing about the title : `` Let Freedom Ring '' with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover , patriot that he is , but also a flag . I loved it , could n't be . Well , the day of the book 's release , I took a day off work ( 've never missed a day of work before in my life ) , and rushed to get this book . It looked better than I ever imagined . With the flag on the cover and the title of `` Let Freedom Ring , '' I thought , finally , technology has caught up to our patriotism . I expected a book filled with flags , flags with effects . Maybe some firework effects . Boy was I . I opened the book only to the colors and . No . No blue . No stars and stripes . I quickly turned the pages , looking , searching for flags . I found none , no sound effects either , no fireworks . At that point , I went into a 4 year long depression . I nearly committed suicide at points . It 's only now that I can bring myself to review this man 's book , patriot that he is . I say this so you know what you 're getting yourself into .

The very `` Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book '' was published in 1950 ( still ) , revolutionized how cookbooks were produced , and was an best-seller . The recipes were the result of thorough testing in the company 's kitchens and in homes across America . This was cooking from scratch with very reliance on convenience foods in its pages . This gradually changed as Betty and her books became more and of a shill for General Mills ' products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company 's bottom line , but to the detriment of cooking . The two cookbooks that came out in 1961 and 1969 were both loaded with recipes and tips/helps , although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience -- especially in the 1969 edition -- but this was still relatively in proportion to the majority of the recipes . If you have one of these books , treasure and keep it ; you 'll never see their likes again . The edition looks but , like the editions , the number of recipes has been drastically reduced . Gone are the variations , which are especially missed in goods . It was having recipes of cakes that were sized for two people or families and having mixing methods to choose from . Now way too recipes are of the `` dump and stir '' method instead of choosing methods that would insure the results . Also gone is the very , assuring , voice of . Yes , there are recipes covering a wider range of ingredients and styles , but they are mostly versions . It 's that the folks at Betty Crocker now seem to think that no one really cooks anymore and ca n't be bothered with preparation of dishes , which begs the question of why General Mills even bothers to publish these cookbooks anymore . The `` Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook '' is a bet for those looking for an , guide . It has a layout , the recipes and ingredients are generally of a quality , and there are recipes and variations than Betty Crocker 's had in some time . Even better , if you care at all about the quality of the food you eat and serve your family , I highly recommend the cookbooks of Cooks ' Illustrated/America 's Test Kitchen . Their , cookbook is called `` The America 's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook . '' The recipes are tested and reworked -- dozens of times , if -- to be the their staff can make them and you get directions in preparing them .

However , he does n't seem to offer honesty about why this book has been so . Either he 's guilelessly or avoidant : in either case , considering how this book has become . Is it because it offers the advice on how to navigate the most and path from singleness to marriage ? No . For the majority of singles , the approach described in this book will be too and contrived to be . couples have actually gotten together this way . The reason why this book , with its overwhelmingly readership , has sold so well comes down to one reason : there is a SHORTAGE OF SINGLE CHRISTIAN MEN , as documented in CampuslifeCollegeGuide.com ratios , and the Barna Research group website which estimates the shortfall to be in the MILLIONS . Christianity Today recently identified the gender imbalance as being the issue that `` rises to the '' for singles . Because Christians are encouraged to look at circumstances as springing from `` God 's plan '' for their lives , of the women faithfully avoid doing the math , but certainly feel the lack of attention . Unfortunately , this often gets boiled down to some kind of `` Christian guy thing '' , but it probably has to do with the complacency that accompanies the abundance of women : which is the defining masculine climate wherever there is a man shortage , whether it 's New York City , Post-war Russia or your mega-church . It 's not so much a lack of leadership , but a lack of males . And so the idea of courtship appeals to the longings of Christian women frustrated by what they perceive to be a lack of initiative taken by Christian men , who they greatly outnumber . Since reading Christian books about relationships can be as titilating as any romance novel , of these women will pour over every detail looking for the one piece of advice , the one thing they can change about themselves that will make a difference . means they stay on the self-improvement treadmill , fuelling a singleness industry with its slogan `` The Gift of Singleness '' that refuses to tell them the truth about the Christian man shortage that is the cause of their singleness ! Of course , their lack of contentment ( an innate response that tells you that things do n't add up ) is something they are told to repent , ironically by pundits who themselves will not repent of how they profit from this relationship . But as long as these women can be convinced that their discontent is caused not by unnaturally protracted singleness that 's the result of the Christian man shortage but their by failings , there 'll always be a market for books like this one . genius ! What 's , there are `` consequences '' that can go along with Harris ' model for `` courtship '' that he does n't really address : 1 ) Because all initiative taking must be based on a guy 's intention to marry the woman , it makes asking a woman to do anything a BIG DEAL to him . This can have sub-consequences : ( a ) It creates a lot of anxiety for guys in terms of their and ( getting turned down for a date is enough , but imagine having your `` marriage proposal '' crash and burn ! ) ( b ) It fosters crushes , as stakes get so with the guy investing all kinds of time and energy in figuring out that this is `` the one '' , he might not ever do it ( c ) Ironically , it can boost up the guy 's expectations in terms of a woman 's looks . Because the guy has to have everything worked out in their heads ( that yes , this is the kind of woman I want to marry ) lot of guys end up not bothering to spend time with girls who do n't LOOK like whatever their `` wife prototype '' might be . Guys who date and do n't make a deal of `` a date '' are more to ask out women they never thought of marrying and possibly end up getting married anyways ( In `` How to Get a Date Worth Keeping '' , Henry Cloud explains how couples will admit that their spouses were n't really `` their type '' when they first met ) . 2 ) It keeps people from the humbling reality check that dating provides . dating ( as practiced in countries , where a guy will ask out tons of women , get turned down by of them until he has a `` '' ) teaches you where you stand with the sex . You ask your way down your `` ladder of options '' until you find your ( likewise for women , in terms of dealing with the facts about who 's asking and who 's not ) . With courtship , a man or woman can nurse an prototype of what they want in their heads for years . The idea that it 's not to have any flames to compare them to is FALSE . You 're off being compared to their girlfriend/boyfriend ( a being with chunky thighs and all ) than with the Angelica Jolie/Brad Pitt that has filled their imaginations since adolescence ! 3 ) It reduces opportunities that promote the acquisition of skills needed in a context with the sex . It reinforces the pattern of immaturity you commonly see in Christian singles circles . 4 ) It 's to the woman to have some guy spring a marriage proposal ( which is essentially what courtship is ) on her without any notice that the guy ( who 's had a start on working out his feelings ) is romantically . women seem to need some time to progressively get used to the idea of having a date with of the guys who would realistically ask them , let alone entertain the thought of marriage . 5 ) It also heightens the significance of anything the men do when interacting with the women in their circle , who inevitably end up reading too much into their behavior and expecting too whenever any nuance of interest gets expressed by a someone they like . Kind of like , `` he 's a , sincere , Christian guy and he would n't be spending this kind of time with me if he did n't think of me as marriage material , right ? `` ... not always so . If we are to stand back and take a look at it , the courtship redux really has n't gotten off the ground : it works for too people at this time . Maybe the world has changed too , or perhaps there are issues today 's Christian singles face in the mating game that need to be dealt with : as the confusion about `` the gift of singleness '' and the shortage of men . I would recommend Debbie Maken 's Getting Serious about Getting Married : Rethinking the Gift of Singleness for an view of courtship that embraces the ordinariness and universality of marriage , instead of this oldy .\", \"More errors In addition to the errors listed by others , I see missing letters in the middle of words , quote marks that are the style ( backticks instead of quotes , done inconsistently ) , indentations ... it 's a typesetting nightmare . disappointment\", \"ruined by its ignorance of sexuality I found this book embarrassing to read - not because it 's , but because it so clearly illustrates how the Italians got their reputations as lovers . Is this the that literature can give us ? This clearly of anatomy , let alone sexuality . It 's also . Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of man and even more woman , and then spends of the book trying to knock down every character and concept . This is his method of proving the superiority of his ideal . He drips way too contempt . Everything outside of sex is , meaningless , . Attempting to derive enjoyment from the `` life '' makes one ; being paralyzed makes one ; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence 's and way makes one , or , or spiteful ; not being to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of `` woman '' or `` man '' ; and so on . Looking at art is . Everything in Paris is . Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly . Reading the book without his openly commentary on what 's `` '' with everyone except C. and M. , one might easily conclude that Constance does n't really seem now that she 's sleeping with the gamekeeper , and Hilda does seem in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing `` that kind '' of happiness as and druglike . He even seems to imply that her being so with her life is yet more proof that there 's something with her . Of course Constance is wretched , because she does not have that one thing that , in Lawrence 's view , really matters in life - not Mellors , but Mellors ' equipment . This book does degenerate into phallus-worship , which makes the author 's hostility toward `` druglike '' pleasures seem sort of ironically . Hilda is precisely because she can derive enjoyment from pleasures : from Venice , from the feel of the sun , from jazz , from dancing . This seems to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman . Hilda is also described as than - she is a `` user '' , with suggestions that she is and - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a man , only to walk away when the dance is over . ( This may be why at one reviewer called the book sexist , since obviously Lawrence does n't mind if Mellors is and behaves as a `` user '' . ) It 's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is consistently knocks pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one 's body . Everything is except sex - and not just any sex , but his notion of sex . This is where readers will have the most trouble . Lawrence clearly defines a `` '' woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with examples . A woman who lays there `` '' is clearly an example . Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc . Lawrence does n't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or is n't doing could even be related ; it 's presented quite clearly as a difference between women vs. women who are not only physically , but in character . On the hand , a woman with an urge to be In Control - that is , one who insists on moving herself , rather than sitting and letting the man do what he will - is when Michaelis is the male ( because he 's premature , and meant to be ) , but it turns when it 's women in and especially Mellor 's Bertha , who just refused to come when she should out of spite . Bertha just had a ( ! ) urge to be In Control , demonstrating her essentially and nature . The thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he `` '' her . As for all those things that women so frequently enjoy ? Forget it . Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at sometimes and , but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly , nothing . A Woman does n't need foreplay . Just hop on and go , and if she 's what she ought to be , she 'll feel crashing waves and tides sooner or later . These were what I found the most embarrassingly - that a woman 's duty is to lie there , not too , but not too , and come when she 's supposed to ( and if she does n't , it 's her fault ) ; while a man 's job is to climb on top and `` perform '' . All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly set of assumptions that are , unfortunately , not . The truth is that a woman 's vagina is not the inverse of a penis ; there 's a thing that both males and females start out with , which in a man becomes the penis , and in the woman becomes ( or remains ) a clitoris . Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the body part . Women have always known about their bodies ; surely a man so to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken time to research how women really feel about things , preferably apart from what women think men `` want to hear '' . This , too , is no doubt why it has been accused of being `` sexist '' . The author ( or at Mellors ) openly blames women who can not or will not `` come to the crisis '' when she ought , as if it were entirely of the woman 's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man . It 's also that science will eventually prove ( if it has n't already ) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be ' emotionally as well as physically . For all that Lawrence spends an lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly , even emotions and desires - as `` intimacy '' and `` connection '' , both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act , but that there is believed to be an advantage in these differences , based on the notion that a man 's job is to get his DNA out there , while reproduction for a woman involves a and commitment . If this is , it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and attitude toward sex who is the deviant , not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the sire of her child . So - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does , at the time it 's not so clearly that a woman `` should '' feel that way , as to justify Lawrence 's belittling of women whose states do n't match detachment and distance . There 's a lot of talk of `` tenderness '' - in fact , Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow `` tenderness '' - but quite I am on what exactly is supposed to be so tender . The thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her , but even there she only stands out particularly because a sex partner is so to find . I can imagine a woman putting up with - but I can not imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk , who is rude to her instead of treating her as ( remembering she 's a Lady ) when she asks him questions , who calls her c -- t as if that were her name , and generally treats her as if she were a whore . I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of , but this is how their relationship really is ; she spends far too time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he wo n't say and the questions he wo n't answer - for me to find her enjoyment in their relationship particularly . For what it 's , I think life will be better when this book has become . It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their responses - at cost to their marriages , if not their selves . Those who agree that heppiness is linked to satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects sexuality in an honest and fashion . As for those who just want a read - I 'd call it a matter of taste . Obviously some people enjoy this book .

While the guide may be in identifying strengths and weaknesses in your congregation , its theories for projecting growth or your church 's demise are analyzed using and Urban models , and have limited insight into the dynamics of the Christian church in the regions of North America as a whole . limiting in this perspective is the distinctly aspect of church growth which results in a disparity in trying to compare churches and businesses . This is a for analyzing and strategizing , for plotting and planning to stock more `` seats in the pews , '' and makes no mention of the journey or troubles and struggles of the very person searching for belief .

'' It seems that I did n't explain well enough my objection to Styron 's co-opting of the story of a being , Nat Turner , whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book , `` The Confessions of Nat Turner , '' by T.R . Gray . Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray 's book , in which Gray recounts his interview with the Nat Turner , but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his racism . Unlike his depiction in Styron 's book , Nat Turner was married . Styron 's invention of Turner 's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a woman , Margaret Whitehead , is entirely . So is any that Turner did the thing by leading the revolt . In Gray 's account , Turner did not express regret . There is so much depth to Turner 's life that is either beyond recognition or left in this book . Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction ? Yes . The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are to the story he invented . Turner 's relationship with Margaret is saturated in the myth that men are obsessed with women -- lusting for the fruit , for which they must die . That Styron crawls into Nat Turner 's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause . What offends me most is that Nat Turner 's life deserves to be explored by a author who does not condescend or patronize this hero . Instead , we have William Styron 's version of Turner 's life , taken by readers as fact . If one prefers racist fiction posing as a account of a life , then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of `` Confessions . '' But if one prefers reality , I recommend Gray 's book as well as accounts about the slave revolt at Southampton , Virginia . Styron 's book does not provide insights into Nat Turner , slave revolt or slavery itself .

The recipes I 've tried have been , and the instructions accompanying those recipes are fairly and , although the discussions and instructions do n't rise to the level of a cooking teaching tool , as would , for example , anything by Julia Child , Marcella Hazan , Jacques Pepin , or any of the King Arthur Flour baking cookbooks , all of which really teach one skills while providing recipes . In this case , I was already pretty experienced at making cream before I bought the book . Were I a tyro , I do n't think this book would be the introduction , although of course there is nothing like plunging in and trying .

Of all of them , I 'd rate the LP as the 2nd for our interests - as they say , experiences may vary ! Ireland has become a very $ tourist destination , so reflection , we would have been with the Rough Guide . LP has just tried to hard to cover all levels of expense in one guide , and has ended up all of them in the process . I hate to say it , but I 'd rather see them do one thing well than 3 things mediocre at . I 'd still put it above of the guidebooks though . Our and gripe is how out of date the price estimates on everything are . I realize it was published two years ago , but we gradually learned to depend on everything costing about 20 % than LP listed . That 's quite a jump for 2 years , indicating to me either fact-checking for the 2003 edition , or some pretty inflation and a need for another update . Our gripe was the maps . They failed to provide maps for a lot of the cities , and only provided maps of the areas in the ones . Given the rarity of Irish street signage , those maps would have been a God-send for navigation in towns . Also , and this may be a function of the 2003 printing , a lot of the towns in Ireland are instituting patterns in their city-centers , and LP 's maps rarely identified this . A , again gripe is with the existance , or lack thereof , of the restaurants , b b 's , shops , etc . listed in the guide . Probably 30 % of the restaurants in the guide just are n't there any . I realize they must have been when it went to print , but that did n't help us any . Our gripe is the rather coverage of areas of the country . Granted , it reflected perfectly the tourist patterns - coverage of cities and tourist areas along the coasts , pretty coverage of areas . Unfortunately , we did n't just want to go where all the tourists go , so this left our noses still further out of joint . , I 'd say if you want a guide that covers the sightes well , both LP and Rough Guide do that . If you want to keep the expenditures down , Rough Guide does it much better . If you want to go all out , , there 's probably a option , but neither of these two will do it well .

Also , of the accounts were extremely -- -couple are encouraged to fondle one another during labor to keep and . In some accounts , a couple would be making out , while a midwife would massage the birthing mother in her `` parts '' -- turning the woman on and keeping her relaxed . Not my cup of tea .

The teaching of hell or everlasting damnation ( torment ) is a teaching that has been graphed into the teachings of Christianity over 1800 years ago . The century church never believed in a `` hell '' . The theory of hell was brought in by converts to Christianity from religions of the world . `` Hell '' was embraced by the leaders of the church because they saw the controlling and `` converting '' effect of the doctrine and thus it was adopted as `` '' centuries after the resurrection of Christ . Our translations have all been used to continue this teaching as fact , when it is actually fiction . Mostly all versions except the Concordant Literal New Testament and Young 's propagate this fallacy . Do your homework . Go to www dot com and dot dot com and read up . If you scoff then here is your challenge . Do the research from a , perspective and you might find things to praise God about . HIGHLY recommended books are `` The Inescapable Love of God '' by Thomas Talbott ( ISBN : 1581128312 , not on Amazon , you must google it ) , `` The Origin and History of the Doctrine of Endless Punishment '' by Thomas Thayer , `` The Bible Hell '' by Dr. John Wesley Hanson . Go to the sites given above and finally get a view of what `` hell '' is and where it came from . You will find answers to the questions that arise from searching this out . All those who scoff and stop up your ears and move on , to you I say that the hell is the one that your doctrine creates in the minds and hearts of all who have been indoctrinated by it and your view of God that it creates .

Let 's start with the question of Israel 's borders . Do some folks say that these borders ought to be the Nile and Euphrates rivers ? After all , Israel is kind of . Does n't it need , um , a bit more land ? Well , Israel may need a land . But almost nobody is proposing anything like this . I see very Israeli politicians demanding even all of the West Bank , let alone all of Jordan . And as for the Nile to the Euphrates , this is pretty exclusively propaganda . There 's a article by Daniel Pipes in the March , 1994 issue of Middle East Quarterly that goes into this in some detail , in case anyone cares . Yes , we 've seen propaganda before . In the 1930s , some Germans claimed that the Jews were planning to take over the world . Now , what do we see in this book ? What we see in this book is Chris Hedges quoting someone as saying that Israel allows schools to preach that rule should extend from the Nile to the Euphrates . Is there any connection between this and truth ? Yes , there 's a connection . You see , in the Bible ( in Deuteronomy ) , Moses says at one point that Israel 's borders shall run from the river Euphrates to the `` sea '' ( presumably , the Mediterranean , but definitely not the Nile ) . Of course , someone might want to ask a authority about what the Bible says . It turns out that there 's much material in the Book of Numbers , and that is what Pipes says Jews are taught is Biblical . And that specifies a much Israel . In addition , it is quite a leap to go from Biblical borders , no matter how or , to preaching that Jews ought to rule such an area today . Hedges is doing us a disservice here . You may want to check all this for yourselves . In addition , Hedges has an description of the Battle of Khafji ( which took place during Desert Storm ) . Some people who were really there dispute it , however . You may want to check that as well . We also see Hedges describe the behavior of Israeli soldiers in Gaza on June 17 , 2001 . Now , remember that these soldiers are trained to obey orders . Their superiors know that Israel ca n't afford violence . The soldiers are there to protect lives , not to hurt or kill others . And in fact , it turns out to be that in the fighting between Jews and Arabs , the Jews ( as expected ) have rarely been of violence . On the hand , the Arabs , who have rather goals and constraints , have displayed quite a bit of behavior . Nevertheless , in spite of logic and facts to the , in this book , Hedges comes up with the following ( as , I encourage you to verify for yourselves what the truth is , and you might want to start by finding out how people died that day and who they were ) : '' I had seen children shot in conflicts that I had covered - death squads gunned them down in El Salvador and Guatemala , mothers with infants were lined up and massacred in Algeria , and Serb snipers put children in their sights and watched them crumple onto the pavement in Sarajevo - but I had never watched soldiers entice children like mice into a trap and murder them for sport . '' Well ! What is it about Israelis that could lead them to behave in a manner ? Hedges speculates that exposure to all sorts of reading material about the Holocaust has perverted these men . Well , I 'm perfectly prepared to believe that men and women from all nations have been exposed to all sorts of reading material . But I do n't buy Hedges ' conclusion at all . Nor do I buy any of what he says about the behavior of the soldiers . And no , I 'm not in denial . If you believe Hedges , I think you may be in , though ! I 'll stop here . Anyone of saying what I 've quoted from Hedges so far is of saying anything . We readers do not need this .\", 'Book never arrived - very !

It appeared to me that Powers often strained his interpretation of the facts to make them conform to his thesis . For example , when reviewing Heisenberg 's `` Farm Hall '' statement in August 1945 that two tons of U235 was required to make an bomb , Powers suggests that because Heisenberg articulated the lesser amount a week later , and because he purportedly suggested at an date that a bomb could be the size of a football , his `` two ton '' statement was a `` error . '' Equally , if not , is the thought that Heisenberg did indeed grossly overestimate what was required , thereby prompting him to tell Speer in 1942 that a bomb was .

However , the fact that none of his predictions concerning a takeover in America came to pass , coupled with his admiration for McCarthy and truly predictions like this : '' Once the takeover comes , you , like millions of others , who believe in God and man 's responsibility for his actions , can be slaughtered like animals or worked to death in labor camps or brothels for the Red Army . '' p. 20 have forced me to conclude that Stormer 's thesis was overwhelmingly . Perhaps the most part of the book was his suggestion that the American educative system was hopelessly . The fact that None Dare Call It Treason was distributed in school classes rather undermines his argument . the thing is , because None Dare Call It Treason is so exhaustively researched , it is far too to be amusing , even when read ironically . and amusement is the product of propaganda . in closing , i would take Communism over John A.

I recently picked up a copy of Mage : The Awakening not knowing quite what to expect . Since Ars Magica I 've loved Mage . From GURPs I quickly switched over to White Wolf 's editions of Mage : The Ascension , finally setting on the revised copy most commonly used on game sites today . Mage : The Ascension Revised was truly a delight , featuring a complexity never seen before in role playing games . A complexity that made working truly fun , sure there were flaws , without a Storyteller you could easily abuse the ended magic system to do absolutely anything you wanted ... but it was a price to pay for flexibility , possibilities and an all around RP system . Is it to compare Mage : The Awakening with Mage : The Ascension Revised ? Of course not , the game has to be based on its merits and flaws . The problem is that this game seems to suffer from a lack of creativity which pervades the RP RP market . It also seems to be marketed toward a very audience . With the exception of some really RP books ( White Wolf 's translation of `` Engel '' from the , a role playing experience distinct onto itself and wholly , and `` Demon : The Fallen '' - which was unfortunately a flop and still managed to be ) , RP books are typically very bland and all the . Mage : The Awakening is no . Unfortunately it tries to blend mechanics with spells as though Mage books have been too complicated ( which they have n't , unless the World of Darkness market is much than they previously were ... which is a possibility , or perhaps they are n't in depth so much as they are just having fun ) . There is absolutely nothing culturally about the Mage : The Awakening game system . If you enjoyed the Buddhist , Hindu , the forms of Christian , Judaic and outlooks being in your game system , Mage : The Awakening takes a step back from the pluralism/intellectually material found in its predecessors and offers a quick , fun system with no appeal . The background story of Mage : The Awakening is simply . reviews constantly pick on Atlantis , but for a reason : there 's simply nothing else to pick on ! The Awakening is simply of any depth whatsoever , but what it does do is provide some rotes ( spells ) instead . Another problem is that there are no antagonists . In Mage games there were antagonists you could use or not use depending on your game . In Awakening they do n't even offer any choices . This game is obviously online and in settings ( online , where depth is usually called for , Mage : The Ascension is still used quite frequently ) . Some qualities about the book are that it has an production value and it provides a game system to play with . Provided you had an Storyteller present with lots of storyline ideas , you might have a fun tabletop session . But quite aside from the production value I ca n't recommend this book . The problem of all is that it simply has nothing about it ... nothing to make it stand out and be playing over game systems . In an age of simplicity please do yourself a favor and have a patience and find yourself a Storyteller . Go back and read the books that made this one sell like hotcakes - buy the `` '' Mage books - if you still want to , pick up a copy of The Awakening and somehow incorporate it in your game\", \"Awakening is Inferior to Ascension White Wolf wanted to revitalize a product line by rewriting it and they had problems with the system that deserved fixing . They did an job on the core rules and the game mechanics are the they 've ever been . One of the flaws of MAGE : Ascension was that it is dominated by the struggle between the Technocracy and the Traditions , in a manner that reflected Vampire : Masquerade 's clan structure and Sabbat vs Camarilla . One of the flaws of Vampire : Masquerade was that it had this history of `` Caine as the vampire and the Anti-Diluvians as the founders of the clans '' , that overshadowed the game . In Mage : Ascension , Mages saw themselves as having evolved over time and that history had been by the technocracy , so who really knew about the past ? In Awakening they took exactly what they were trying to jettison from Vampire and put it into Mage with the creation of Atlantis and the Exarchs . The Societies that replace the traditions are not as interesting . The replacement of Avatars with Towers does n't make sense to me . The struggle theme remains with the Exarchs but seems a lot less than the struggle over the consensus in Ascension . Awakening is or rotes . For , Mage in a LARP , rotes are , shifting emphasis to rotes improves the compatibility of and action systems , but detracts from the experience where Mages can do almost anything . They split the Entropy Sphere into Death and Fate , which kind of makes sense , except that Death has too overlap with Spirit . I 'm going to use the Mechanics with the world in my campaign . The Mage setting does n't inspire me like the one did . While the Vampire and Werewolf settings may catch on , I think the Mage is going to be a flop -- after the core book I do n't expect to purchase any of the supplements .\", \"Get of the glasses I bought this book but should have listened to my gut feeling ... look at the picture of the `` Forever Cool '' Ms Mathieson on the cover .

I 've found a number of inconsistencies with history that should be to anyone who has read this thing closely . For example , on page 7 Coleman says `` the Club of Rome was established in 1968 '' , but on page 17 he suggests that the Club of Rome played `` a role in the Cuban Missile Crisis '' and `` attempted to sell its 'crisis management ' ... progam to President Kennedy . '' Unless we 've been misled , the Cuban Missile Crisis happened a 6 years before this group was founded . What are readers to make of a passage ? Either it 's a typo and he means 1958 , or , as I heartily , he does n't have a grasp on his subject . On page 9 Coleman suggests Henry `` Kissinger 's role in destabilizing the United States by three wars , the Middle East , Korea , and Vietnam is well known ... '' However , Kissinger , working at Harvard from 1948 , had no role in the U.S. government until the 1960 's , working for the Kennedy Administration . The Korean War , as we are all , occured in 1950 , and ended long before Kissinger had any influence on policy . If it were that Kissinger had an influence on the United States ' policy in Korea , for example , then Coleman would be to address that issue at this point in his text . However , he only leaves us with the `` is well known '' . It is definitely NOT well known , and Coleman is just fooling those readers who think that a book which is to read or which is discussing subjects must be . These are just a of the inconsistencies that I could check in a time that Coleman throws out at you . If you 're not a reader , you 'll be tricked into accepting some really ideas . If you prefer speculation to reason , then by all means gorge yourself in the nectar of `` what ifs '' . If you 're looking for something based on reality , then , rider , pass by\", \"A backlash wolf in sheeps clothing It would take a book to answer all that is with Farrell 's reasoning , but to make a points : 1 . He implies that 'circumcision ' is much the as male circumcision which is astounding but points to his ignorance . If circumcision is about teaching males to endure pain ( actually more about male bonding ) then what on earth is a girl being taught when she has her genitalia cut away and is left with a hole and a life-time of pain and health problems ? ? It 's for protection ? What , or whose , interests are being protected ? 2 . He does not acknowledge that the life-span is to testosterone and all its consequences for males . Castration is known to increase the life-span . Why do men even want testosterone rather than ? Surely ? 3 . The 'instinct ' to protect females is actually to protect the bodies men need for sex and reproduction . As than 50 million females have been killed recently in Asia simply because they were should make us question this supposed 'instinct to protect ' . And protecting females most often translates into ownership and control . This is a logic to that of men in cultures that use the pretext of honor to justify the murder of females . Why do women need protection form their protectors ? Men need to explain their logic here . Is it something like the protection gangs provide for people against gangs ? 4 . Powerless men are created by competition for access to females and again , the testosterone drives this not women . 5 . His views on rape are . Young females have signals whether they want sex or not . These signals do not usually reflect the females desires and concerns and this causes the confusion . Men are responding to fake signals that females do n't know how to override without becoming altogether . 6 . This book is basically about all the hoops males try and jump through in order to rise in the male hierarchy and ultimately get their DNA into numbers of men who fail are the men without power . Farrell wants us to feel sorry for them which is as as men feeling sorry for , and diverting their interest and resources towards , women . 7.Farrell does not explain the irrationality of men rejecting and being about women who do n't sexually reject men ( ie the women ) at the time as they complain about the pain of being sexually rejected so often by women . There must be some logic to it - perhaps situated in a world of being the male who is n't rejected . Duplicity is clearly a trait that farrell failed to mention . 8 . It is a logic that concludes that the people who have been the lawmakers and leaders for millennia ie males , have actually only been acting in the self-interest of females . For men to have evolved a lack of self-interest is . To argue that they have is Farrell 's argument . Of course women also have , intimately tied to that of their children . The very difference is that because we evolved with a mating system where females moved to kin groups to breed males had the advantages of size , kin-bonding , no demands of offspring and time and cicumstances that enabled them to be the rule-makers which included the enforcement of ownership and control of females as they were exchanged between groups for breeding . They may have felt varying amounts of power within that system and they may have felt the power of their sex needs as power but to say that this is actually women having and exercising power is absurdly and to reality . It is another fantasy to add to that of South Sea Island sex and mermaids . This book is interesting for debate and as an example of frustration being blamed on women . Ultimately it is about how some men suffer trying to get access to females and might help us notice that the ' being defined is reproduction . In a market where the supply of sperm far outstrips the market of eggs it does reduce the value of sperm and create competition in males and competition in females for quality sperm and/or extras that improve the outcome for offspring . Embedded in Farrell 's books is the attempt to solve this by encouraging women to 'put out ' . It 's the male longing for 'free ' sex ie the behavior of male animals where post-copulatory costs are carried by females . In animals experience far or disposability as females when they are and concentrate on parenting ie are with behavior . Can we look forward to this in the male in the future and solve the whole problem ? Can we expect men might consider reducing the supply ie their partners and increasing their childcare . Reduce testosterone ? Or is that blasphemy ? The question is What do men want ? The answer is the as ever - sex . The methods of trying to get it are the even when put in a wrapper as Farrell 's irrationality , deceit and manipulation . Perhaps the myth is the myth of ADULT power and we should direct our anger and frustration towards our gametes , hormones , fetuses , infants and children that are the reason males and females exist , are pulled together and apart . At let 's not create a myth that the male somehow managed to evolve a lack of self-interest . How does Farrell hope we are\", \"Over Rated !

First off , I have not read this book myself , so disreguard this review if you want . I 'm reviewing it because based on the reviews and what I can tell here , and from descriptions from my mother , I believe this is the book she used in a attempt to potty-train me . I am 99 % , but she does not remember the title so I ca n't be 100 % sure . My mother described a system where she devoted one day to nothing but potty-training . She got everyone else out of the house , and removed all my toys from eyesight . Then she went through a explanation using a doll and had me try to explain it back , using the doll . She then showed me what looked like a kitchen of toys and candy , and told me I would get rewarded for using the potty that day . I remember all that part . After that she said that we went through a process where she had to scold me for accidents and we did nothing but try to go all day . I was definately enough to be doing this , because I actually remember it . ( I am 25 now , so if this book was published in the 70s or early 80s , I 'm being accurate . ) Now , let me tell you the results . I do n't remember how I felt that day , but I do know that it started something that became a battle for me . I was a very child , and I am a very adult . What mom and I remember was that became a war in our home- and it took YEARS . Because of my sensitivities and my mother 's choice in training methods , I began holding my bowel movements . ( I was urinate in the potty at a age , not when . ) I would hold bowel movements whenever I had the urge to go , even if she put me back in a diaper . I held for weeks at times , and sometimes this required a lot of pain for me ( obviously ) . When it finally got to the point that I could n't hold it anymore , the BM was so that I needed help to go . Sometimes it would get so that the result would happen- I 'd have a diarheaa because the muscles were fatigued . This went on for years , and the doctors kept telling mom that I 'd eventually outgrow it . She tried suppositories , oil , fiber , and even started giving me doses of laxatives . Finally , when I was 5 ( two years into this ) , Mom made a tape recording of me SCREAMING while trying to go to the bathroom . A doctor took pity on us and prescribed enemas . I used them on and off for two years . I was finally fully trained- AT SEVEN . I am now 25 , and occasionally I still notice some health problems that may be to this . Now , obviously there is no way I can fully explain why all that happened , and I certainly can not blame all of that on the book . I was a very kid , and my mom picked a time to do it too ( I had just had a baby brother ) . But I just want to describe the danger of using a method . And I 'm not just talking about the pain I went through if we 're to believe theories about the stage of well , let 's just say I could be his poster child . I am now my highly daughter , who will be 3 in a week . We have been working on this ( no specific methods , just lots of sitting on the potty ) for over a year now , and with NO results . But I 'm not in a hurry , and thats because she 's not , and we need to do this on her timetable , not mine\", \"TOO SEXUALLY EXPLICIT FOR MY TASTE As I was reading this book , I came across poems that were far too sexually for my taste , to name a : `` The First , '' `` Images of Heaven '' and `` Full Summer .

I picked up David Sacks ' book from Borders ' Linguistics stack because of the title . I should have known better . I started the chapter and did n't have the time or intention to finish it . The book is a collection of charts and stories about the history of writing that are to be expected from the title -- in some cases conviniently summarized things in tables and maps -- but lacks , in my opinion , thinking on the reasons behind the origin and prosperity of writing that is found in works ( it is not ) . Even within the 20 pages or so , I was disawayed than a times by claims , misinformation , and distastefully Euro/English-centric . Here are some examples : '' The alphabet was not the writing : Egypt , Mesopotamia , and probably China already had systems . But the alphabet was the most writing system ever found , before or since ( p.1 ) '' -- What about Hirogana for Japanese ? Syllabaries can be much more for languages that do not have a inventory of syllables . `` The 'spreadability ' of an alphabet means that the future of our Roman letters looks very indeed . ( 10 ) '' -- He was speaking of languages that are written in alphabets , as Swahili , , Urdu/Hindi , and Yiddish . And then came this comment on the prospect `` our letters '' . Immediately following the quote , he gave examples of and Tatarstan 's decision to switch to Roman , as well as `` struggling nation '' 's likewise decisions to `` switch to Roman letters for tongues , as a to tie into trade and communications and to prepare their prople to learn English . Tragically , that is and spiritually sustaining while be lost . Yet that seems in the century were are shaping . And it is sobering to reflect that our 26 letters wield power . '' His view of the learnability of the alphabet is also , shall I say . The comment could have come from an gradama who happened have NOT been a teacher for her lifetime . `` An alphabet enjoys on advantage over any writing system : It needs symbols . No sysmtem can get away with so . This makes an alphabet to learn . Students need memorize only two dozen or so letters to begin building toward literacy , which typically takes about another five years of instruction '' . And -- he writes -- because of this simplicity , children can become before the age . `` This fact has made the alphabet historically the vehicle of mass literacy . ( p.5 ) '' Well , `` vehicle '' is a very way of framing it . At he is not saying that where there is alphabet there is literacy . Mass literacy was nevery a goal before the inducstry revolution . Now Sacks joins the ranks of you-know-who 's by implying that the Europeans and ideals were destined to take over the world because they had the alphabet and probably the mandate from God . ( Guns , what guns ? ) Sacks also compared `` our 26 letters '' -- as if writing is patented at the USPO -- to Chinese . `` schoolchildren normally take three years longer than children to learn to read and write , with of that time devoted to mastering the symbols . '' This is completely misinformation . Learning to read Chinese is not , but do a research , you will find studies over studies and books over books on studies of literacy ( including my ) . I 've nevery seen a study that substantiates the lag . By the way , Sacks almost never gives citations . I think that 's . This explains my disappointment with the book -- I shold n't have any expectation from the start , had I known who David Sacks is .\", \"I kept waiting for her to leave him The hero is a , brute who does not deserve his wife Kassia.He should have been made to marry Joanna the woman he was betrothed to.I could n't get Graelam raping Kassia , I really couldn't.I know this is England and women were more or less treated like chattel , but on.Kassia is a girl who does everything to please this philandering , brute of a sleeps with one of the servants after he marries Kassia , when she confronts him he threatens to beat and rape her which he had already done ( I shuddered again right there ) .There 's not one but two women undermining Kassia 's authority and she sits back and takes this , please !

When I was a teenager , I 'd go on candy binges that required insulin doses bordering on the , and I got through school with only the zit . I 've read that for a number of people , can be a factor for acne , but obviously our experience points to something else as the cause ( this assumes you eat reasonably well - malnutrition is n't ) .

There are lots of statistics , but rather defending video game playing and how it 's successfully preparing gamers to succeed in the future . I did learn a things . I got a dose of reality about why it seems like everyone under 35 plays games extensively . I see that the *gamer generation* has a lot to offer . I also seriously wonder about the gaps in what they have to offer . A thesis of the book is that gamers learn how to think and figure things out , because games are about figuring out how to beat the game . Interesting , since by the examples cited , it mostly appears to be trial and error with no logic involved . I call it by trying anything , as opposed to learn by thinking . Both have their place . Supposedly , gamers are more to take ( theoretically controlled ) risks as well . Somehow the authors see the dot.com boom ( and bust ) as an endorsement of the future of business in the hands of gamers ( who largely ran the dot.coms ) . I see a story than the authors from those days of yore . I could go on , but I think you get the point . The book says ( nothing ? ) about how games are helping gamers learn math , science , or reading . Personally , I believe those skills/knowledge are MUCH more to a person 's future than the ability to learn trial and error . Maybe the conclusions of the authors will prove to be . I hope so . But personally , I 'm for any business that runs on the gamer mentality that I understand to be endorsed by the book .\", \"Poorly researched , and not accurate for drugs Unfortunately , Sidney Wolfe and the `` Worst Pills '' business enterprise is riding on the reputation of Public Citizen as a champion for consumers , but has failed to live up to it with this guide . In some cases , warnings are included regarding drugs that are not based on reports , but rather , are based on the marketing literature and information from the companies themselves -- hardly an , source of information . Consider as one example the book 's `` Do Not Use '' warning regarding the prescription drug , Armour Thyroid . Rather than offering any research to support this recommendation ( because there IS N'T any research ) , the `` guide '' instead quotes the AMA and the American Thyroid Association , two groups that greatly enjoy the largesse of the drug makers who want to put Armour -- a far less drug -- out of business . If this is the sort of `` information '' you want about the drugs you take , you might as well go ahead and just read the company pamphlets . If millions of patients taking Armour Thyroid were to follow the advice in `` Worst Pills , '' the thing that ends up for the worse is our health .

Hank Hanegraff is a replacement theologian where the nation of Israel is concerned . He is further from the truth where prophecy is concerned than groups , to include pretribulationists . Indeed , his `` scholarship '' is no scholarship at all ; it is propaganda ... . To see scholarship , get Tim Cohen 's materials ( see below ) : Tim LaHaye , Jerry Jenkins , and others in the Pre-Trib circle , as Ed Hindson , Tommy Ice , Chuck Missler , Zola Levitt , Thomas McCall , John Hagee , Grant Jeffrey , Marlin Maddox , Perry Stone , Texe Marrs , John Walvoord ( deceased ) , etc. , continue to put forth the deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago . The notion of a rapture is to scripture , it is to the teachings of the Church , and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming . These men are novices and not prophecy `` experts '' or `` scholars '' by any stretch of the imagination ; they are those who tickle the ears of Christians . Why continue to be deceived ? Tim Cohen , in his book , `` The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea , '' provides biblically and evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW . Not only that , the author ( Tim Cohen ) has now put out the presentation on the issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ : `` The Rapture '' . If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the rapture , then you need to hear Tim Cohen 's `` The Rapture '' ( based on a volume in his forthcoming `` Messiah , History , and the Tribulation Period '' series ( see Prophecy House 's site for details on these items , which are also via Amazon )\", 'An effort too far in jargon I found this book to be pretentiously over complexified .

Jews could also have died because bombing was and prisoners lived close to the crematoria . Too in his charges is based on too evidence .

This book desperately struggles with , language that has neither voice nor colour , giving the descriptions of place and people about as life as a body on the morgue slab awaiting autopsy . Add to that is the fact that at pages could easily have been cut from the length by a Editor , thereby maybe adding a smidgen of tension to the plotline .

Particularly the reference to artists and musicians , who typically have struggles with life , and are n't on nine just because some professors might like them in a couple hundred years .

The Paleo Diet is based on an premise- the idea that what we ate before agriculture suited our needs perfectly because our bodies had been bred by evolution in response to our what we could find to eat in our environment . It seems like a leap to assume our ancestors naturally gravitated towards exactly what we need to eat . Animals in the do make choices of the time , because their decisions are . creates a problem that does n't exist for behavior as it does for humans . Sometimes we do things out of curiosity , or laziness , or beliefs . So , considering the behavior of humans , who is to say our ancestors were any more about their needs ? Even the book suggests humans ate what they did out of trial and error , frequently just trying whatever they encountered in the wild . The fact that foods are frequently in nutrients than foods does not mean that you must subscribe to a diet to take advantage of this fact . Rather , eat food . Just about anything from the wild will be a food , unless the environment from which it comes is and that is a very problem . Meat is a very thing nowadays , not like it was in the pristine wilderness of the era . The Paleo diet would be a thing if we were still in that world . Now , we need to worry about metals in flesh , and antibiotics and growth hormones in feedlot animals . Beef will have some naturally 3 if the animals were allowed to wander in a more or less fashion , as they did when the most employed mechanism for animal control was the cowboy . This is no longer . The cut of meat in your supermarket is taken from a feedlot animal , fed the food and in conditions in the extreme . Basing a diet on meat in this day and age can be . You must choose your meat sources carefully . Meat made from animals raised on pesticide-free in a caring manner can be very to find . I found Loren 's rejection of all products of development a little too minded , and in some cases . There is nothing at all about grain foods or legumes consumed in moderation , and loss could occur for people if they ingested grains and legumes but conscientiously avoided only the products of agriculture : fructose corn syrup , acids , sweeteners , foods raised non-organically with pesticides and herbicides , and improperly raised food animals . My objection to the book is nearly one hundred pages ( about half ) of the book is dedicated to the convincing you this thing is and and your time . I think the forward to the book or perhaps the chapter alone would have been for that purpose . After a while you get the feeling Loren is trying too to sell this idea to you , and it really interferes with the flow of the book . Further , a lot ( but not all ) of the studies cited show only advantages of aspects of this diet . The claims that you will experience loss and feel than you ever have are to imagine , and peppered throughout the book . But it 's to believe with the than overwhelming studies cited . One nitpick . One way to compensate for the lack of food taste enhancers like salt and sugar is the use of herbs and spices . something very much like the paleo already exists as part of cuisines around the world . It 's a pity the recipes included do not explore those , but instead offer somewhat watered down and fare instead . Espscially cuisines frequently make with alot of the ingredients that are on the paleo diet , and their spices make it all the more . I found the recipes far too and .\", \"Biased , , and misleading If you want a and account of the Arab war against Israel , this ought to satisfy you . Shlaim tells us that Jabotinsky , in discussing Zionism explained that `` if the cause is just , justice must triumph . '' I think Jabotinsky made a very point here . You see , beings will , if given the chance , tend to buy land in the places they wish to live in . The ones who can make use of the land and wish to do so will be the bidders for the land . If consists of stealing that land from them and justice consists of letting them buy the land and keep it ( which they will wish to do if they are offered only prices for it ) , then it is to see what the triumph of justice would mean here . In , it would mean a Israel and a triumph for Zionism . Shlaim appears to have missed all this . To him , Zionism is . And to him , the triumph of terror and theft is both and . He tells us that a Levantine Arab state `` is . '' I disagree . It may be . But it would serve no purpose . It would not help Jews , Arabs , or others . Its purpose would be to damage Israel . The people of a state do not as yet have an language , religion , culture , cuisine , or policy . So I think there is still hope that sanity may prevail here . Shlaim also tells us that this Arab state will be `` , demilitarized , and territorially divided . '' Is it just that this , if , provides even reasons why neither side might want to create it at all ? And could that make the appearance of this state even less ? Or at less ? And the author also explains that both sides in the conflict will have to make `` compromises , '' and that Jerusalem will have to be `` the subject of bargaining . '' Really ? Is having peace and prosperity with borders a compromise ? For either side ? Of course not . Shlaim is kidding us if he expects us to believe that war , poverty , and destruction are somehow less . Had Shlaim been writing about France and Germany , we 'd have seen at once that the viewpoint is . He 'd have been telling us that the National Socialists needed an state in France , either to replace all of France or part of it . He would have laughingly dismissed claims on the basis of the idea of France being ! He 'd have sternly explained that a National Socialist state in France was both and .

ART\", \"I 'll Pass On Carb-Loading One Hour A Day When you have lost weight , it 's a very thing for others to be about how you lost your weight and kept it off . Whenever they have heard me tell my story , read my blog or book , or found out that I did it on the lifestyle , one question invariably has come up from time to time : '' What do you think about this diet where you can eat whatever you want for per day ? '' My reaction to these people was usually something along the lines of this : '' That 's absolutely ! There 's no way you could ever lose weight and keep it off using this method . '' I did the Atkins and honestly have not stayed on top of all the bazillion diets out there . But there was something very about this plan that it made me look around to find out about it . did I know there was an book out there about this very so people had been telling me about . It 's called The Carbohydrate Addict 's Diet and it was written by a husband/wife team Drs . Richard and Rachael Heller . The CAD diet , as it is referred to , makes the claim ( and I agree with it ) that people are addicted to carbohydrates and need to be weaned off from depending on them for sustenance . Just like a drug addict gets doses of their drug daily so they can eventually get by with and less , that concept is what goes into the CAD diet . If people think the Atkins is , then check out what you have to do on the CAD diet : BREAKFAST : meal consisting of protein and fat . LUNCH : meal consisting of protein and fat . You are allowed to eat any bread , fruit , milk , juice , and vegetables . Absolutely NO snacking whatsoever except for coffee or soda . You can not use sweeteners either . Sound appealing , anyone ? Hmmm ? I suppose if that 's all there was to this diet , then NOBODY would do it . But there is one aspect of the CAD diet that you probably will be in . DINNER : Eat amounts of protein , vegetables and dessert of whatever you want to eat in whatever amount , but it must be eaten in a time frame . You can even enjoy a beer or glass of wine with your `` reward '' meal . How 's that for incentive ? You basically starve all day long just so you can get to those minutes at the end of your day where you can say hello to the buffet line ! Who would n't enjoy a diet that lets you do THAT ? ! Well , I 'm still very about any change that encourages you to eat the very foods that got you overweight or to begin with on a basis . I caught a lot of flack from my low-carbers about my `` planned splurge '' meal every weeks during my loss . However , the Hellers give you a DAILY planned splurge ! ! ! What 's up with that ? We can blame this on Dr. Rachael , who stumbled upon this way of eating when she weighed 268 pounds after being on diet after diet . She became a psychologist to learn about why people overeat ( ostensibly to help herself in the process , too ) . She had skipped breakfast and lunch on a day she was fasting for a blood test and then , like of us would , ate to her heart 's content whatever she wanted for supper . The morning she noticed she had dropped 2 pounds . Thinking something must have gone with her scale , she tried it again the day , skipping breakfast and lunch and then eating a dinner and once again , she lost another pound . She played around with what would eventually become The Carbohydrate Addict 's Diet and went on to lose 150 pounds which she has kept off to this day . The frequency of eating carbohydrates is the key behind the CAD diet . The Hellers believe that anyone who consumes ANY amount of carbohydrates during the day will set off all the bells and whistles in your body that you are faster than if you avoided them altogether . They say that eating carbs throughout the day is like giving lots of doses of cocaine to a cocaine addict . It will make them crave their poison even more ! That 's why you basically avoid eating carbs on the CAD diet until the end of the day . This process of getting over addiction is a one , and the Hellers think they have found a plan for making it work for lasting loss in people . I still ca n't get around the fact that you do n't change the habits of the people who have packed on the pounds . , they basically starve themselves throughout the day before they eat their one BIG meal each day , but how is that stimulating the metabolism and preventing the obstacle to weight loss success -- HUNGER ! There 's no way I could do the CAD diet because I enjoy eating every 2-3 hours to keep my process constantly in motion . I truly believe this is one of the things that has helped me lose the weight and keep it off . Since you can not snack or use sweeteners on the CAD diet , it would literally drive me insane even if there was that `` reward '' meal at the end of the day ! Wan na take a test to see if you are a addict ? Click here to take the Carbohydrate Addict 's Test . I scored a 2 , which means `` You do not appear to be addicted . '' No kidding , ya think ? Dr. Jonny Bowden , author of Living The Life , examined the CAD diet and said the uses some science to make their points about why their plan works . `` While it seems that there are both insulin and serotonin abnormalities in the , it 's not at all that levels of insulin depress levels of serotonin , as the Hellers hypothesize -- in fact , the majority of the evidence points to the response . '' Furthermore , Dr. Bowden said he is concerned about the lack of attention on exercise as part of their loss program , stating `` it 's to both maintaining weight and to raising the rate . '' While The Carbohydrate Addict 's Diet has worked for a lot of people and I always tell people to do what works for them to lose weight and keep it off , I still have my reservations about this program . I think I 'll pass on my body for one hour a day\", \"Silly book This book is just . If it works for people and helps them lose weight I realize they will be . However , it is not .

I kept hearing all these things about FREAKONOMICS , a book by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner , so when I ran across it at 25 % off , I did a freakin ' thing and bought it . I thought , What the freak , I 've got a pretty mind and I 'm to seeing things differently , to discovering viewpoints . The doubt started early when I got the book home and I first noticed the glowing comments on the dust jacket from the likes of Time , The New York Times , The Washington Post , and The Los Angeles Times . When all of the news agencies are lining up to tell me how a publication is , I 'm immediately going to be ' . Author Malcolm Gladwell tells us on the cover , `` Prepare to be dazzled . '' Well , evidently Ol ' Malcolm is dazzled a lot than I am . ( I wo n't even mention the smug mug of Stephen Dubner that taunted me from the book 's dust jacket because I do n't want you to get the idea that I judge a book by its cover . Or in this case , a writer by his physiognomy . So I wo n't mention that . ) If you 're the kind of person who is amazed to learn that 70 % of auto accidents occur within 10 miles of a driver 's home , then you just MIGHT be dazzled by FREAKONOMICS . If I tell you that the company that issues its employees only 3 shirts , thinking that it is cutting costs , is probably increasing its overhead , and this fact astounds you - if you must ask `` But how ? '' - then yes , buy FREAKONOMICS and be dazzled . Mostly what FREAKONOMICS offers ( when its conclusions can be trusted ) is just what we used to call `` sense . '' But since America has been reduced to a bunch of corpulent , zombies staring vacuously at that box of SURVIVORS , and AMERICAN IDOLS , and LOST knuckleheads , sense now appears to dazzle the ( when you can sever them from that box and put a book in their hands , that is ) . I dove into FREAKONOMICS hoping to find my purchase worthwhile . I got no than page 13 when my fears were realized : everything would require and verifying . On that page , Smug Mug tells us ( based on a report by the Institute Of Medicine ) that `` drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health . '' Fortunately , I read YOUR BODY 'S CRIES FOR WATER by Doctor F. Batmanghelidj over a decade ago so I already knew what a bunch of bunk that was . In chapter 4 , Smug Mug `` proves '' that legalizing abortion in 1973 with the Roe v. Wade decision was for a drop in the crime rate . This represents the centerpiece of his book , both literally and ideologically . The thing the reader must accept is that there really has been a drop in crime since the 1990s . On page 92 , the author acknowledges that the police in Atlanta were discovered to be crime in the ` 90s in hopes of landing the 1996 Olympics . Well , would police forces nationally have an incentive to underreport crime generally if it has actually dramatically increased since the ` 90s as predicted ? True , being might be means to an increased budget , but it sure would make your department appear inept and to maintain control . And surely the Chamber Of Commerce and the business interests would frown on that perception . Let me ask , do YOU actually feel you 're less to be the victim of a crime now than you did in the 1990s ? That 's , me neither . There 's so crime now that some of what was once reported to the police agencies goes , and recently , an officer friend told me that cops can no longer engage in some of the micro-policing they were to do in the ` 80s and ` 90s because crime is so now . In dismissing factors for the drop in crime ( if this claim is a verity ) , Dubner states that increased police personnel accounts for only 10 % of the drop . Having a bit into the nature of police work than does the , it 's that I find myself even contending with the stats Smug Mug uses that actually WORK AGAINST his theory : I believe the hiring of police officers since the ` 90s could have impacted the crime rate only minimally - than the 10 % - while actually increasing the coffers via traffic citations significantly . And Dubner concludes that firearm laws `` simply do n't bring down crime . '' ( Be sure to read the fascinating book , GUNFIGHTERS , HIGHWAYMEN VIGILANTES by Roger D. McGrath , for a decidedly and viewpoint ! ) In dismissing all explanations for the drop in crime except abortion , I did n't notice any mention of the increase in homeschooling and the proliferation of schools since the ` 90s , and I wonder if that might have some bearing . Ya think ? Yes , I think Smug Mug is . He calls some abortions a `` crude and sort of insurance policy . '' Not `` . '' Not `` . '' But then I did n't expect Smug Mug to call a sin a sin . And even if Levitt and Dubner 's hypothesis is , that abortions have lowered crime , the fact remains that not every child would have eventually murdered an person , but every child was an person murdered . So why are we even discussing this ? I 'll tell you why : because the folks can feel a slightly shifting consensus , and now they 're pulling out all the stops , trying to `` statistically '' convince the masses that they 're safer with all those criminals missing . I find this repulsive ! ( And there are studies indicating that those missing people have , and will continue to have , a impact on society . ) I wo n't even go into chapter 5 , What Makes A Parent ? Suffice to say that as ( surprise ! surprise ! ) all the statistics Dubner employs nearly always seem to confirm the rightness of the dogma on each issue . Funny how those numbers always crunch beliefs . Just know that if you 're a working mother , you have n't cheated your child in the , but if you 're a dad who thinks that an spanking is in order , you are `` . '' If your kid is watching lots of TV , it is n't turning the `` child 's brain to mush . '' ( No word on whether or not it 's turning his/her morals to mush though . ) And the studies ( that we are called to pay attention to ) show `` that a child 's character was n't much whether or not he was sent to day care , whether he had one parent or two , whether his mother worked or did n't , whether he had two mommies or two daddies or one of each . '' ( I 've often wondered what might have happened to me if my Mom , who was home of the time , had n't been there to hammer the dangers of drugs into my head day after day , year after year , while I was growing up in the ` 60s and ` 70s . ) I 've given FREAKONOMICS two stars because I did find the section on the naming of children very , as well as the story of Stetson Kennedy 's fight against the `` three Ks . '' But if you 're than I am , you 'll borrow this book from your library rather than paying money for it . Economically speaking , that 's just `` cents . ''\", \"This book is Bedlam !

I hated it for the reason that it represents all that is about MFA program writing in the 30 years . The emphasis is entirely on STYLE . Forget story . Forget that your reader needs some reason to be reading the . Just throw out and string together language and the reader will follow you anywhere . Some of this thinking goes back to Henry James , some of it goes back to Virginia Woolf who was so of books with plots or dominating conceits ( like H.G . Wells ' THE TIME MACHINE ) . The 100 pages of this novel are about a estate deal and the people to whom Frank Bascombe is trying to sell a property . It 's brilliantly written . In fact , it 's so brilliantly written that I had a lot of problems seeing a sportswriter being so and articulate about his life , his loves , and the region of the country he inhabits . This book has no driving plot . In fact , it 's an arbitrarily chosen conceit : what happens on July 4th in the life of one guy . It 's not James Joyce 's ULYSSES nor is it trying to be , but EVERY thought this man has is in this book . And none of it is related to a plot or story or any reason whatever why a person -- any perso -- should pick up the book . Indeed , that seems to be the crux . I read this book because it was by Richard Ford , a man whom all of my colleagues in the mainstream fiction world revere . You must read this book , they said . So I did . And I consider it an waste of my time . To be , this is a judgment call , but I 'm allowed to make it . EVERY reader is allowed to make that call . But I know I 'm in the minority in this . This book is supposed to be one of the novels of the 25 years . But will it be so in another 25 years ? Are novels now only to be monologues ( which Virginia Woolf preferred and said so in her essay `` Fiction '' ) ? Perhaps our values are changing . Perhaps the MFA programs in this country are in cultivating style rather than story . But what it eventually evolves into is a form of narcissism , wherein the author writes at length , putting on the page all of his or her thoughts about whatever and we 're supposed to . . . what ? Applaud it ? I believe that the authors we 'll remember will be the storytellers . I do n't think Richard Ford is one of them .

So my surprise when , after receiving this book from a friend of mine for Christmas , I read the account of the Children 's Crusade of 1212 . I had done research on this topic , so I was horrified to read the completely account of what occurred . Had the author not read any analysis on the subject from the 50 years ? If he had , he would have realized that there were actually two crusades - one consisting of mainly people led by Stephen of Cloyes who , when told to turn back by King Philip II , did so . That ended that crusade . The one , led by a shepherd from Germany named Nicholas , led a group across the Alps into Italy . Some left for home while others continued on to Rome . It 's to note that in Rome , received dispensations from their crusading vows because these `` children '' were either too or because they were . Perhaps until relatively recently , people believed in the Children 's Crusade because it represented a morality play or because some historians gave too credit to chronicles ( like Chronica Albrici monachi Trium Fontium ) which were written long after the crusade supposedly occurred , rather than relying on sources . Nor did they realize that the latin word `` pueri '' used in the chronicles can have meanings ( as men rather than children ) . In the analysis , you just ca n't rely on books like these to really teach you history . The you can do is read what they tell you and then try to verify it . If only the author had bothered to check the History Channel 's account of the Children 's Crusade on their website , or perhaps read the paper done by Peter Raedts in the Journal of Medieval History , or even just checked out the brief but entry online in wikipedia . The book gave two pages to this event , and sadly got it completely . For this oversight , I am compelled to give it one star .

If he can try to take credit for people 's work he 'll do so . He even managed to find someone to write an introduction for the book who was prepared to refer to the Levy distribution as the Mandelbrot-Levy distribution . The most example of self-aggrandisement has to be the caption to a picture of the Brooks-Metelsky-Mandelbrot set where he mentions that two mathematicians only scaled part way up his ' of this set and received Fields medals for this work - the implication of course being that Mandelbrot has actually seen the view from the summit . Disgustingly he does n't even deign to mention the names of these mathematicians . One time I criticised Mandelbrot publicly and someone responded by pointing out how peer reviewed papers he had published so he ca n't be all . But in this book Mandelbrot actually reveals to us how he used his network to work around the peer review system . Astonishing ! I think it 's also pointing out that there are some ideas in this book and so it 's not completely .

But to describe the nonfiction accurately , I 'd have to use words that Amazon will remove from the review anyway . For the part , the pieces collected here represent a side of Heinlein I strongly dislike . Though I respect Troopers_ , it 's never going to be my Heinlein novel no matter how times we quibble over the definition of `` fascism '' -- and I 'm not going to have respect for the nonfiction in this collection . And mind you , it 's not because I disagree with Heinlein 's opinions ; it 's because he gave arguments for them and called people names when they differed . Some of the stuff collected here is to the point of being . ( At in his fiction , he was to create characters with points of view that differed from his and get into their heads well enough to present them sympathetically -- in , to grok them . Not here , boy . ) Heinlein ( who bought into the Korzybski/General Semantics fad pretty early on ) spent a lot of years dismissing philosophers as tailchasers who derive their premises from their conclusions . But his attempt at philosophy , as represented here in e.g . `` The Pragmatics of Patriotism '' , is very nearly the writing on philosophy I 've ever seen . Then , too , people who knew Heinlein report that despite his gentlemanly demeanor , he could be pretty toward people who disagreed with him . Well , he 's certainly here ; anybody who does n't agree with him on the need for buildup is dismissed as a poltroon or a . Even in the event that I thought he were _right_ , I would n't find this a very approach . Perhaps more surprisingly , his writings on _science_ are n't very . Asimov 's reputation as the `` explainer '' is in no danger here . This volume is only to _Grumbles from the Grave_ in cementing Heinlein 's reputation as a rather fellow whose characters were generally company than he was . When I want company , I 'll stick to D.B . Davis , Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis , and ( maybe ) Lazarus Long .

In his book , The Four Agreements , Don Miguel Ruiz , embodies four principles for experiencing freedom in life . He says that we should be with our words , not to take anything personally , do n't make assumptions , and to always do our . The basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents . He calls this process `` domestication '' ( p. 6 ) . Ruiz says that 95 % of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection . The agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the bonds that get in the way of our energy and to transform our lives . While there are nuggets of truth throughout the book , some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what I would consider to be to be an conclusion . In some instances he uses scripture to support his claims ; however , in looking further , he takes some of the passages from the Bible out of context . Some of his ideas are presented as if they were ideas , but I would think of us by a age , should already an understanding of these principles . Although his book has been highly rated , I hold the position that Mr. Ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer , therefore , losing standing with me as a reader . According to Ruiz , as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our beliefs . When we go against the rules we are punished ( or rewarded for compliance ) . The fear of rejection leads us to agree with , or become something that we are not . In essence , we become a carbon copy of someone else , as our parents . He says our tendencies are lost and we judge people based upon these agreements . He boldly states , lacking data to back it up , that 95 % of our beliefs are based upon a lie ( 13 ) . The implication is that we are merely nothing than a society of mindless , `` domesticated '' individuals , hurting ourselves , judging and victimizing people along the way . This kind of thinking negates the teachings associated with parenthood and the aspects they bring to our lives . By his interpretation , if 95 % of what we believe is a lie , then 95 % of what our parents taught us is also a lie . I would disagree . There are people who exist today as , members of society who I 'm would point out they too became a copy of someone else 's beliefs and values . If these role models are only filling our heads with lies and teaching us how not to be ourselves , by his interpretation , we do n't need parents , teachers , or leaders . He undermines our paradigms and omits that as adults we do have the ability to choose a path , which I believe is our right of passage . By his rational we lose the ability to choose our destiny . Instead , we become victims of it . One of the things we agree upon is his agreement , be with your word ; however , he misquotes the ( John 1:1 ) when he says `` In the beginning was the word and the word was with God , and the word was God . '' He uses it to epitomize the use of `` word '' as in what one speaks ( 26 ) . Looking a down in that passage , it also says `` The word was made and dwelt among us '' . This passage is not talking about a form of speech , or speaking , but rather `` Jesus Christ '' . Christ became and dwelt among us . In that chapter he says that `` sin begins with rejection of yourself '' ( 31 ) . However , in Christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law ( 1 John 3:4 ) and that sin is neglecting to do God 's will ( James 4:7 ) . It 's not about self , but about disobeying God 's ordinances . While I agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for , this is not a concept . children have learned by the age of 6 that if you do n't have something to say , do n't say it at all . In his agreement , do n't take anything personally ; he says that nothing people do is because of you . While this is to some degree , he leads the reader down a path of extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head , it was nothing . So in essence , when Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot by Amy Fisher , her expression of displeasure regarding Amy 's behavior was nothing than a form of projection because according to Ruiz `` you are dealing with yourself , not me '' ( 51 ) . No , realistically , Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot because Amy Fisher wanted her . This kind of encourages victims to remain in relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims . As an , I 'm that someone took 9/11 personally . According to Mr. Ruiz he takes neither nor criticism . It seems to place myself so far above reproach , that I would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism . When my College writing professor , gave me his opinion regarding my work , if I were following the authors line of reasoning , I would believe that my professor was `` trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his garbage '' as Mr. Ruiz suggests ( 49 ) . I would rather believe that my instructor has my interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a writer . Another agreement is about not making assumptions in life . He says when we make assumptions , in essence , we create drama . Unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely . Assumption is a part of a thought and reason ; even within the community a hypothesis ( or assumption ) is formed in order to test a theory . In order come to school each day I must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree , and that he or she must be enough in life to make it to work everyday . In his forth agreement , always do your , he claims it is based upon the actions of the three agreements , stating they will only work if you do your . Again , these are principles that almost any child has learned . While Ruiz does indeed some ideas , his concepts begin to unravel when he does n't back up his statements with facts , but instead takes a concept and follows an line of reasoning to reach his conclusion . I ca n't completely discount everything that he says , but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and rationalizations .\", \"Even 3 paragraphs show the inaccuracy Hart disputes O'Reilly 's claim that the US `` gives far and away more tax money for coutries than anyone else ... ..

What Paine basically proposed was a century form of the welfare state , with taxation , subsidies for child birth , and statist amenities .

It 's the stuff of Summer thrillers to be taken to the beach . But 319 pages later , the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the book in the jacket . Almost immediately , you 'll notice that Smith 's writing is as as the jungles that make the setting . However , despite the stream of words , his descriptions are often . Plus , there are no chapter breaks , which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue . Next , the characters themselves begin to fall . There are only really two couples to keep track of , and yet it 's for the third of the book to distinguish them . There is to keep you in what they 're doing or why they might be doing it . Smith 's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts . This seems obviously and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters ' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam . By the end of the book , the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each as the reader is in them . And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting as Mayan mythology or lore , forget it . Aside from language barriers with the locals , there is no reason why this story could n't have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains , the Saharan desert , or anywhere else . The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico , archeology or mythology at all . Ah yes , the danger posed . Well , I ca n't say much at all because anyone could give away the book with one line of explanation - that 's how the plot is . The reviews that fault this as a story masquerading as a novel are exactly right . Suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is ( and you 'll realize it well before any of the characters do ) , it 's a eye-roller , as if to say `` I read this pages for THIS ? '' . By the time the story concludes , it 's than . The characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you 'll start rooting against them . Eventually scenes of start piling up in an and attempt to interject some action , but even aside from being misdirected , it 's too too late .

How could anyone write anything so', \"Definitely not Alcott 's `` Women '' I started reading this book expecting to like it - it 's , related to Little Women , won the Pulitzer , does n't feel like fluff , etc . However I had a really time getting into the book . For one , the language sounded much more than historically . I 've read works from the time period she 's supposed to be writing in , and rather than feeling in keeping with that era , this book felt of someone who makes use of her thesaurus . Also , I have n't read her book so did n't enter this novel with a trust for the author . Consequentally , I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women , I became . She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work .

The half of the book is also really . This could just be my taste , but the half moved so slowly ! The book started to pick up about half way through . Overall , the story being told and the Civil War aspects were n't , and could be a story in their right if she 'd just speed things along at the beginning . However , I think Brooks did the book a disservice by linking it to Little Women . I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book , because she was really changing their characters ( than Aunt March ) . The choices that Brooks ' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott 's book . In the afterward , Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women , even commenting how the March Family in Alcott 's book is n't very , and how `` Nobody in life is a goody-goody as that Marmee .

It does not use photographs of the masters to illustrate the topic , neither does it show how composition works in art , which I believe is very . 3 . examples are in color , while ideas on composition are best explained using B W photographs . 4 . but not , composition is about meaning , making a message , not just how to balance elements within a frame .

There is no protoganist and not one character worthy of admiration -- and after a while , their actions just become . The author 's soul must truly be an ugly one to have devoted so time and energy to using his mind to generate so acts of evil throughout the book . It starts out promising but by the time you get to about halfway through the book or so you get a sense that your very soul might be sucked out of you and permanently stolen by the heart of Neil Gaiman 's darkness or one of his minions . Additionally , the characters ' motivations change like the shifting sands , nothing they do makes any sense except some movement towards doing and en masse like some sort of coagulating bacteria or disease .

Reading the book , you get the feeling that the characters are what Ms. Glass ( a privileged woman of a age ) imagines teenagers , or New Mexicans , or chauffeurs , or nannies , or even people to be like . She is like a tourist who voyeuristically delights in cultures without really understanding them . The teenagers and the Santa Fe inhabitants are the most examples of caricatures . Greenie might be the most , and although I understood why she was falling out of love with her Alan , I was n't sucked along with her when she falls in love with `` the Charlie '' . He was only very mildly and certainly not ( even temporarily ) losing your child over . With Saga , she manages to develop her most character , but Saga 's life is left floating and unresolved at the end . Even the appearance of Fenno , who I loved in Three Junes , lacked intensity and seemed . All and all , a very novel . You have to wonder , since reviewers are pointing out all of the problems with character , what good is her editor ?\", \"Over Rated I heard all of these things about this book etc ... ...

In , please give this book a pass !\", \"Wow , what a disappointment ! `` The Most Anticipated Book in the History of Poker ! '' exclaims a blurb on the cover . Well , if so , I can tell you that a lot of people have been , or are going to be , VERY disappointed . Comparing the Super/System from 1978 with this book is , to paraphrase Mark Twain , like comparing lightning to the lightning bug . This book is of a tribute to Doyle Brunson than it is `` A Course in Power Poker . '' Johnny Chan writes a fairly Preface in which he lauds Brunson , but does n't say anything about how to play . Then we have Brunson 's Introduction in which he tells us mostly about the contributors to the Super/System . Next there is an sketch by Brunson entitled , `` My Story . '' ( If you want a book that gives the flavor of Brunson 's `` story , '' get a copy of According to Doyle ( 1984 ) . It contains 47 chapters in which Brunson recalls his days and life on the road . ) Following `` My Story '' is a history of Texas Hold'em by Crandell Addington which is n't , and then there is the chapter that could actually be considered part of a course in power poker . This would be 43 tips from Mike Caro cribbed from his lectures and books . However the tips are hardly `` '' for SuperSystem2 as claimed . Beginning with Caro 's cute but now very , `` In the beginning , everything was even money , '' or all of the tips have been recycled . For example , Tip # 18 , page 146 , `` WHEN A FREQUENT BETTOR CHECKS TO YOU ... do n't bluff '' is just about the as Tip # 10 `` Seldom bluff if bluffers have checked into you '' found on page 137 in Caro 's Fundamental Secrets of Winning Poker ( 1996 ) . In fact Caro even recycles his `` '' tips in this very book . Tip # 31 says that PLAYERS STARING AWAY ... are almost always more than players staring at you , '' while Tip # 40 says in part that `` OPPONENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BET OR RAISE IF THEY ARE : ... ( 3 ) staring away . '' Jennifer Harman 's chapter on limit hold'em is so that it 's . There 's not even a hint of anything . There are a number of books on the market that cover the ground much more thoroughly . I especially recommend Small Stakes Hold'em : Winning Big with Expert Play ( 2004 ) by Ed Miller , David Sklansky and Mason Malmuth or anything by Sklansky . Also her insistence on referring to hands backwards , `` '' ( e.g. , on 252 ) instead of `` 76 '' is annoying and to a convention . And the caricatures by Russ Braun ! They are so and flattering that each may have passed inspection by the subject 's mother . Comparing these to the witty and work by Stan Hunt in the is like comparing a cliche to something and . Brunson does n't even look like himself . Here he 's just a , smiling , boy kind of guy -- except in the , , drawing gracing page 7 which WAS drawn by Stan Hunt , copied from the book . are the chapters on Omaha and Stud Eight-or-Better . However , although Brunson has Bobby Baldwin billed as his author of the Omaha Eight-or-Better chapter , actually it was written ( as acknowledged ) by Mark Gregorich . He does a job of introducing the game and giving some of the strategies , and I 'm he is a player , but what about Bobby Baldwin ? Well , as CEO of Mirage Corporation and President of the Bellagio Hotel and Casino , Bobby is far , far too to write the chapter himself . So he just lent his name and his supervision . Can you spell R-I-P-O-F-F ? Perhaps the most part of the book is Doyle 's chapter on no limit hold'em . It is little than a reprise of the chapter in the book published 28 years ago . Also recycled is the section on `` Names of Various Hold'em Hands '' on pages 628 and 629 . The references to Raquel Welch ( `` 38 '' ) and Broderick Crawford ( `` '' ) seem than a out of touch . Indeed , this book is tribute to Brunson and the success he and the book achieved . And that is a shame , because this book is billed as an event in the history of the publication of books on poker when in fact it is something hastily put together to flatter Brunson and , hopefully , the pocketbook of those involved . One thing : there is a Glossary , for beginners , which is okay as it defines things a `` Deuce , '' `` Flush , '' `` Four of a Kind , '' etc. , but seems a for `` A Course in Power Poker . '' though is this definition of a `` Deck '' : `` A term often used to describe the deck by players who feel they 're not getting enough or winning hands . '' Players may indeed remark that `` the deck is , '' but the origin of the term comes from the fact that a deck used by cheaters that is switched into the game tends to be `` '' to the touch since it has not been handled since it was stacked . line : pass\", \"Disappointing with a capital quot ; D quot ; I 'm in a mood today , and feeling -- hence the two stars .

I was dismayed with this book . James Frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had . One of the things an addict has to grasp is the TRUTH so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is to save his life and often the lives of ones tangled up in the mess with him . Lies are what `` slips '' and `` enabling '' and `` '' and those catch words that describe continued misery and failure . Recovery is nearly without honesty . So , can we look at this man 's `` memoir '' and expect it to offer anything of value ? It 's poorly constructed , , and . Even if Oprah had n't exposed him , the writing takes the tone of `` whoppers '' like Frey 's account of the drug house visit in which he `` rescues '' Lilly . reviewers and Smoking Gun have written about the episodes one by one , and I ca n't improve on that . Suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more than a soap opera . Story lines in a soap may look like life to one who is isolated from life , the way A Million Little Pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by addiction . A addict with delusion could be misdirected from a course of treatment with result . I was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or . Like a joke of some kind .

Cussler 's books portray that it 's OKAY for Americans to go into countries - with which we are not at war - and kill its citizens for some government agenda . That it 's OKAY for our government to hire out `` ops '' in because it 's against our laws to do so openly .

The 700 pages are , , and really . You come away thinking `` I really do n't care bout this stuff '' - I do n't care about the dynamics of trash , about J Edgar Hoover 's bathroom habits , Klara Sax 's depression and annoying infatuations about roof tops , about characters that just do n't have depth to really care about . At the end , even potentially characters like Albert ( the one on the baseball quest ) become to bear . The book in fact had the feel of going to a citizen home . I read this book , as perhaps others did , expecting a book about the mafia or about figures in the underworld . What I got was a book with a chapter , some tidbits here and there about how life used to be in the 50 's ( fear of weapons , duck and cover classroom exercies ) , and a lot of knowledge about the trash business . The `` '' epilogue , as reviewers call it , really does no justice to a reader who has spent so time toiling over Delillo 's story telling . I am with stream of consciousness writing , or chapters , or even chapters , but the methods used in book served no purpose than to make the reading . Was this book about how our lives are versus the things that occur around us ? Or how each of us is on an quest ? Or that the 50's-60's-70's-80 's were just years of fear , and the 90 's are years of greed ? I am still , I still do n't think any of these themes came across well . Please - not pretending to be a sophisticate , , or - but this book is really not worth the time or effort . You can be staisfied by a number of books , including the `` The Corrections '' by Franzen or `` The Cold Six Thousand '' by Ellroy which cover a period or themes and do not make you so frustrated or disappointed at the end .

This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really and . And this is exactly what `` Insomnia '' is . This is n't a spoiler , just the author 's note : at the end of the book we read 10 , Nov 10 , three years in which King took to write this book . Three years which were evidently wasted . The King books I 've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification . `` Insomnia 's '' Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with . He is , kind , has gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and . His counterpart Lois Chasse does n't come across as . Instead she serves as a character who has no flair or identity than being in love with Ralph . King does n't usually do that with his characters . characters with roles in this book come across as and , like Ed and Helen Deepenau , the three bald doctors , and Ralph 's confidantes . Then there 's the abortion mess . This issue crumbles midway and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story . Though King does provide an and seemingly commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker ( albeit with a tranparently slant ) , it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no than a story device . I gave the book two stars because I am an writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are to utilize as part of a writer 's arsenal . The devices were and all thru the reading I asked myself , 'How is King going to get through this ? ' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert 's narration ( via third person ) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance . It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story , he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him . This is a tool for a beginning writer , but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning . One thing , the villians just do n't work . They are not frightening , they are not , they are not or malign . Three doctors with scalpels and scissors ? Their defining characteristics are being and does that really frighten anyone ? The villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his madness .

Hayek , mentions this fact as a footnote in chapter 17 of his book , `` The Constitution of Liberty '' published in 1960 , as evidence of the disillusionment of intellectuals , when they were confronted with the observation that individualism and socialism were mutually . Those intellectuals had not accepted the proposition when advanced by Karl Mannheim in his book , `` Man and Society in an Age of Reconstrucion '' ( 1940 ) . Mannheim had been a opponent of socialism , but Orwell had only been converted after being exposed to `` The Road to Serfdom . '' By 1960 , when Orwell had become a world renowned author and opponent of Big Brother doublespeak , Hayek recognized that the proponents of socialsm which was dying as a ideal , were now introducing the concept of the welfare state . While virtually everyone today have been effected by Orwell 's works and his prescient warnings about Big Brother , how of us are of Hayek 's infulence on him ? `` The Constitution of Liberty '' provides its readers with an wealth of knowledge , of which this one footnote is only a example . Each reader is bound to be effected in one way or another by the knowledge imparted to them , and this is one of the lessons to be learned about `` liberty '' which requires the `` rule of Law '' to exist in today 's society , but that Rule of Law must be . The failure of today 's inteligencia is to fail to fully comprehend the meaning of liberty and its necessity in a world of confusion from the confrontation of competing civilizations . Unfortunately , Hayek is no longer to help guide us through the millenium . Fortunately , he has left us a volume of work , perhaps more today than it was when written years ago . While `` The Constitution of Liberty '' is in itself , it should be kept as a reference book . Hayek 's works , `` The Road to Serfdom '' and his volume , `` Conceit-the Evils of Socialism '' published in 1980 is a continuation of Hayek 's life discertation on the evolution of mankind 's growth from a tribal , society which did not require man to understand or protect Liberty , to a group of city-states that prospered because of the Liberties protected in Athens , but only moderately , so that a and wise philosopher as Aristotle would believe that freedom could only exist as far as a man could yell . Hayek 's understanding that Civilization has prospered from individualism , that it has grown and prospered from the freedom to travel , to trade , to exchnge property , material , and . He explains why man must be , that humans progress from trial and error , not from conceited belief that one way or another way is . That to be and liberated is to be to make mistakes and government should exist to protect individuals'rights to make mistakes while they attempt to profit in their ideals and beliefs .\", \"Awful This has to be one of the most books I have ever read .

In fact , quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the time ! ( Ahem , women readers will know what I mean . ) But Clifford treated Connie poorly .

First of all , it is to install -- this is always a sign of a product : no product that was properly QA 'd would be released in condition . Second of all , the product is just a version of a spreadsheet . I could literally use Excel or MS Access to catalog my books just as well as this software . You actually have to input EVERY piece of data associated with a book . There is no excuse for anyone with an Internet connection to have to manually input book data .

The book was written as if he fast-forwarded through his youth and got stuck on ` pause ' when he got to college . While this is obsessively to him , it was tiring reading page after page of accounts of his college days .

Kingdome Come is an Elseworlds ( what if ) story set approximately years after the retirement of Superman and subsequently nearly every hero . As the story unfolds , the reason Superman quit is revealed . A hero named Magog killed the Joker and was put on trial for murder . When the public cried out for his aquittal and it was granted , Superman quit in disgust . The results of the choosing a hero that would kill are very in the future . The children of the heroes we know are everywhere . They hold society in a state of terror as they enforce justice and fight each in the way they see , destroying property and causing chaos . Wonder Woman approaches Superman in his exile in the wastleland that is Kansas and asks him to return and lead the heroes in returning order . When Superman returns to the eye in issue # 2 , it sets into motion an Apocalypse as described in the Bible , but with Superheroes being the catalyst . The Justice League rounds up every violent super human and puts them into a prison designed by Mister Miracle ( The world 's escape artist ) called the Gulag . All this is shown from the viewpoint of Norman McCray , a pastor and friend of the Golden Age Sandman . He is led on his journey by the Spectre ( DC 's Angel of Death ) I absolutely love this story by Mark Waid , the way he wraps characters and events into a Biblical epic is . The art by Alex Ross is jaw-dropping in it 's realism . The characters are in their depiction , especially the Flash- a blur wrapped in lightning wearing a helmet . Issue # 3 ends in a cliff-hanger with all the villains rioting and breaking out of the Gulag . As Superman races to the scene , he is thrown to the ground by the person that could , Captain Marvel . I still remember waiting for issue # 4 to come out . The scene between Captain Marvel and Superman was voted # 1 by Wizard magazine and is worth the price of this trade alone . Even without this scene , I would rate this as one of the mini-series ever , but with it Kingdom Come is # 1 . The to this series is that you have to already know something about comics to fully appreciate all the subtleties Waid and Ross weave into this story . Nearly every DC character is pictured at once . ( A geek 's paradise I guess ) After reading this I actually liked Captain Marvel , who I had always seen as an even version of Superman . The fear the heroes have of him and his power level make him to laugh at , despite Jerry Ordway 's Power of Shazam series to the .

Burke 's characters , with the exception of the always and touching Cletus Purcell , are wearing and becoming less and less . Dave Robicheaux becomes and preachy in each novel . His tirades would make any Prohibition era preacher proud . Burke has fallen into a trap of using the imagery and phrasing again and again , and it makes the reader wonder if he is n't cutting and pasting paragraphs repeatedly .

Twelve stringed guitars have always been strung that way , Leadbelly did n't invent that tuning , okay ? ) If I read the word `` phallus '' in a sex scene in one of Burke 's books one time , I think I will just give up . The phrases are getting - really . The preaching about corruption and alcohol got books ago . One thing to be about in this wreckage of what was once a series - Bootsie , Dave Robicheaux 's wife , is , though that does n't keep her out of the story . But at the reader is spared another element that has been repeated to death - the moment in every book with Bootsie in it where she gets up in the night , with Dave , and goes to sleep on the couch . I 've had bets with readers as to what page Bootsie will do this stunt ( which then opens up the opportunity for another sex scene with the `` phallus '' when they kiss and make up ) in each Burke novel where she is a character . Thankfully , also , Alafair , Dave 's adopted daughter , is far away at college , and we are spared her teenaged brattiness which became in the books and yet another repetition of the story of how Dave came to adopt her , which is included in every book since the introduction of the Alafair character .

How well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you ? How well can you predict what people in your country will do ? Would every Italian , if they could write well , have written the book as Mr. Barzini ? I seriously doubt it . So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man 's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million Italians . After reading it , I felt even more strongly that books , though possibly , are a waste of time . An book about unicorns -- but do they exist ? Anthropologists have been concerned , for years , in getting the quot ; inside view quot ; -- the view of a culture as seen by the person within it . While Barzini is , he tries to visualize Italians as seen by visitors , then explain to those of us not enough to travel there , why they are as visitors see them , or why they are not as foreigners may think . This is not a gambit . Cultures are based on factors -- like history , patterns , religion , family , etc. -- -but the results are just that , . Barzini covers topics -- the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality ; the family vs. the state ; modes of achieving success ; the split ; Sicily and the Mafia ; and , the tragedy of Italy 's domination by foreigners . But nothing really connects . There are only , impressions , nothing very to grasp . The reader is left with a handful of stereotypes . Barzini is at his when describing the lives and operandi of characters in history . These sections were and . But his portrayal of quot ; character quot ; is , contradictory , and ultimately , unconvincing .

Even then , disagreements on the apportionment of blame will likely continue on for decades after . Given the interest in the conflict and the nature of the negotiations , works exploring the climax at Camp David remain . Some Mr. Swisher 's work because he was not in fact part of the negotiating team , but instead was at Camp David only for negotiations . That seems to me . Clayton Swisher clearly did `` work '' to prepare this text ; sadly both his rather bias and almost desire to settle scores renders what could have been an work at suspect . Mr. Swisher 's book follows on the heels of Dennis Ross 's `` The Missing Peace '' and , given Mr. Ross 's involvement in the negotiations ; no one could be blamed for looking at works as well . However , Mr. Swisher spends much of his time looking to lay the blame at Mr. Ross 's feet , even when he makes claims that others at Camp David , then Mr. Swisher directly contradict his statements . for example is made in this work of Mr. Ross 's change of `` Jerusalem '' to `` Jerusalem '' in a draft as if this caused the breakdown of the agreement . Unfortunately , Ross 's change in fact was a return to an draft after being changed by Robert Malley , a member of the US team and now often a talking head representing the point of view , who made the alteration without consulting any of the parties . Malley has never denied this . Moreover , days would pass before the negotiations actually broke down . Swisher 's target , perhaps seeking to sell books by putting forward a contradictory point of view , shifts the blame wherever he can to Israel and the US negotiating team . While an effort might well be , Mr. Swisher often twists facts , making excuses for gaffs while blowing facts out of all proportion . For example , Mr. Swisher brushes aside the days lost when Mr. Arafat and the team insisted that Jews had no link to Jerusalem or the Temple Mound -- a position farcical on its face -- as posturing . However , he never mentions that ideas , undermining the people very claim to the Land , serve only to inflame the parties and make agreement almost . Nor does Swisher ever consider the Palestinians failure to negotiate in faith , treating every Israeli offer simply as a base line , rather than offering any proposals of their . Again , even Robert Malley concedes that this strategy by the Palestinians doomed Camp David from the start . Swisher 's dismissal of all Israeli concerns reaches a crescendo when he simply casts aside as Israel 's interest and the Palestinian 's refusal of any compromise for the `` right of return , '' or the claim that all Palestinian who left the area of Israel and all their descendants must have a immigrate to Israel , a held by no people . As to the fact that this would lead to the destruction of the State and that the Palestinians are thus expecting Israel to commit suicide , on this problem Mr. Swisher remains . Lastly , one can not help but marvel at Mr. Swisher 's coverage of the events after Camp David . That Yasser Arafat led a war against Israel rather than offering an proposal for peace is dismissed . Mr. Swisher combs through events searching for , magnifying , and twisting any event that will make Israel look , while at the time minimizing or even ignoring the waves of terrorists who have murdered hundreds of Israeli civilians in blood . Mr. Swisher even parrots points of propaganda so thoroughly disproved that even leaders no mention them , as the claim of massacres during operations in Jenin , which exhaustive study long ago proved to be nothing than a fabrication . Curiosity will cause readers to ask why Mr. Swisher takes this extremely view . Fortunately , he lays out his rather point of view at the very beginning of the book by writing the following , `` The reason for Arab and Muslim anger against America has been and remains support for Israel 's oppression of the Palestinians . '' Again , one can only muse as to why Mr. Swisher does not take Osama bin Laden at his word when he spoke shortly after 9/11 that his manifests from the presence of Christian soldiers in the heart of Islamic lands like Saudi Arabia and later Iraq . Surely neither the bombings in Madrid or more recently in London had anything to do with Israel , but it seems for Mr. Swisher 's world view , it is at the step of the state where all blame is to be laid .\", \"Oh boy , `` lets understand the terrorist '' garbage The religion of peace is at it again ! In response to the popes words , muslims all over the world respond with violence , destruction , rage , hatred , burning down buildings , burning effigies , issuing fatwas against the pope , and even shooting a 70 year nun in the back . Wow , peace from a religion of `` peace '' . If Islam is a religion of peace , then all the guns in the world are flowers , and every bomb , a feathery pillow . Violence for words . Destruction for speech . PLEASE ! This is a religion of war , and bereft mindless 70 year bags like Noam have begun to lose a lot of function with age .

How people will die at the hand of Muslims before the world finally , and for the time , holds the Muslims accountable for their actions , rather than someone else ? Well Im sick of the left defending this cesspool of Islamofacism . Im tired of the media beating up on Israel and coming to the side of tyrants who shoot 70 year nuns in the back in response to spoken words .

Shaara does n't even begin dealing with the trench warfare of the war until the 1918 's , when the Americans , focusing , as I noted before , primarily on the air war that occurred in the years of the war . I should point out that the air war would be interesting reading in a book of its . Here , however , it seems to reflect that the author did not deem the ground warfare fought by non-Americans worthy of a story . Or was too to research the events enough to write about the ground war from the or perspective .

In books one through four the trio of Harry , Ron , and Hermione were characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day . Book 5 had them doing angsting and screaming than mystery solving , and more than day saving . Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a job miming the motions the characters would have done . This book Harry seemed to care more about romance . A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and moments on par with the of fanfiction ; which had no background or build up from books . A character from the background , whom Harry barely even notices all through the five books , is suddenly the most and girl in the school in fashion . characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance , none of which bore any revelance to plot or story . Harry also had a decline in morality and intelligence . The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one mistake after another . The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying , frozen in a position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose , under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly episode with Malfoy . As to the plot of the book . Poorly done . Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me . of the 'revealations ' in the book revealed nothing not already known or from information , and the culmination of what Harry was did n't amount to anything .

What can not be neglected is the myths spread about the United States by the Neoconservatives and followers of Leo Strauss . The United States is not a unique and snowflake . The idea of freedom was decried by Strauss as destructive of the society of the USA and he told his followers to keep the public in line with myths about US exceptionalism . After the the Soviet Union was kicked out of Afghanistan , both Qutb and Strauss ' followers believed they were the cause of it .

How one can hope to convince anyone of the truth of a theory without supporting it with facts ? Yet information is extremely in Rose 's book . There is a deal about what he thinks of biologists ' opinions , but almost no observations from biology . Nonetheless , in his preface he aligns himself with the practising biologists `` who spend a part of every working day thinking about and designing experiments '' , dismissing Dawkins and Daniel Dennett as `` people who either no longer do science or never did it .

I do n't believe that you can write books about character . Is there really a thing as quot ; character quot ; ? People are just too , too . How well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you ? How well can you predict what people in your country will do ? Would every Italian , if they could write well , have written the book as Mr. Barzini ? I seriously doubt it . So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man 's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million Italians . After reading it , I felt even more strongly that books , though possibly , are a waste of time . An book about unicorns -- but do they exist ? Anthropologists have been concerned , for years , in getting the quot ; inside view quot ; -- the view of a culture as seen by the person within it . While Barzini is , he tries to visualize Italians as seen by visitors , then explain to those of us not enough to travel there , why they are as visitors see them , or why they are not as foreigners may think . This is not a gambit . Cultures are based on factors -- like history , patterns , religion , family , etc. -- -but the results are just that , . Barzini covers topics -- the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality ; the family vs. the state ; modes of achieving success ; the split ; Sicily and the Mafia ; and , the tragedy of Italy 's domination by foreigners . But nothing really connects . There are only , impressions , nothing very to grasp . The reader is left with a handful of stereotypes . Barzini is at his when describing the lives and operandi of characters in history . These sections were and . But his portrayal of quot ; character quot ; is , contradictory , and ultimately , unconvincing . Finally , if you are a lover of lists , you will thrill to this book , because there is a list on nearly every page . Myself , I got pretty tired of those lists .

If you just want entertainment , which might support any stereotypes you have about Italians , then this book could be for you\", \", but has a errors It has the to be a book if the author had taken some time to actually look into each breed .

This leads me to conclude that if there were that errors on one dog breed , who 's to say that it 's not on breeds too ? I was quite and to see the `` dogs '' put as dogs . Labradoodles , Bichon/Yorkies , Cockerpoos , and Bull Boxers are NOT dogs . They are given a name and sold for staggering amounts of money .

'Skeleton Man ' starts off with a rather premise , tying the story in with the life collision over the Grand Canyon in 1956 . While an author can occasionally pull off a story with a connection to 'real life ' ( See Nelson De Mille 's Fall ' ) , Hillerman fails here . The story is bogged down with bland and supporting characters , motivation , and very that could really be called 'action ' . Chee ends up joining Leaphorn in the background for of the story .

However , in the end , the book 's errors just piled too . It opens well , with the story of Sony 's founding and rise from leaking offices in a department store just after World War II , to becoming one of the world 's companies . This is a and story , and Morita tells it with flair . Then , unfortunately , the spiral begins . Morita consistently takes his experience at Sony and assumes that every company operates the way , which is a fantastically assertion ( as the years of Japan 's seemingly recession have shown ) . He also frequently takes management techniques , like trusting employees and giving them leeway , and tries to brand them as somehow uniquely `` '' . Then there are all the claims which are simply , as Japan supposedly having the world 's construction technology . ( It actually has perhaps the in the world , as the Kobe earthquake unfortunately demonstrated . ) Or how Japan is supposedly a nation fanatically devoted to not wasting anything . ( Yet it only recently discovered the concept of `` goods '' , instead of throwing furniture and clothing away . Plus , garbage trucks groan under the weight of the world 's overpackaging . ) Reading between the lines , a person can see the roots of so of the problems that Japan faces today . For example , Morita spends a deal of words attacking the excess of lawyers in the United States . While this can , of course , sometimes be a problem , it also gives U.S. consumers a way to protect themselves . Japan 's consumers , on the hand , without an court system , are almost completely at the mercy of bureaucrats and executives . Complaints about products or chemicals in drinking water are simply ignored , because they lack any threat of action . In another example , Morita praises the `` trust '' and agreements without contracts that exist among corporations . In reality , this `` trust '' is a death pact , as inefficient companies are propped up by their buddies , instead of letting them fall and create openings for and entrepreneurs . than the glimpses into Sony 's history and culture , this book is only as a museum piece - yet another in the flood of `` Japan is going to take over '' books that came out in the Eighties .

And , of course , who is the ` life judge ' and does this judge have the authority of the state to take something from someone ( who has a life that is deemed too rewarding ) for someone who has life that is too .

'' But the literalist reading this book need make no effort , when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of Christians up to heaven in the `` Rapture . '' Though the characters and their roles are , the book specifically references the passages for the believer . The story line opens with the moment of discovery after the mass Rapture event , and the remainder is a melodrama concluding with born-again conversions . In the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not to the idea of progress toward a utopia driven by advances and the cooperation of people of all traditions . Instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a pessimism about prospects for reform . Billy Graham 's biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham 's `` evangelism '' for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing problems . Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the `` Tribulation Force '' or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell 's Moral Majority . They are also committed to an vision of the end of the world and are to institutions as the United Nations . Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the of the United Nations . The U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially , while evangelicals and liberals - e.g . Baptists , Lutherans , Presbyterians , Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines . data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism 's growing appeal in reaction to society . I see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the `` left behind '' in the backwash of the flows of change in society , and as Christians who believe it is better to stay behind .

If this is so , I am definitely not missing much by not having read the trilogy . This is a really piece of sociology , characterized by a technologically analysis . Why did I give it two stars instead of one then ? Well , it does have some parts . Catsell 's analysis of the origins of the internet is an bit of the sociology of technology and what saves the book from determinism . He also presents some convincing data ( gathered by people ) that use of the internet for socializing does not suck people into an world , alienating them from the world of interaction ; this happens in the case of a people , but people use the internet to enhance their already existing relationships . The rest of the book basically argues that the network format of the internet is reshaping the rest of society in its image , with everything from business to governments to movements adopting a network form in response to the rise of this technology . This is , frankly , reductionism . It does n't even stand up to a test of chronology -- a lot of the developments that Castells argues are driven by the internet predate the explosion of usage in the . As Castells himself admits , businesses were already taking on of a network form before the internet appeared time on the scene , and movement scholars have shown the is of movements . On top of this , Castells shows an enthusiasm for all things networked , whether they be corporations or the movements that oppose these corporations . I 'm really at a loss to understand how one can enthuse about both of these phenomena . Castells does see some of the problems with the network society -- loss of job security and the divide , for instance -- but he tends to downplay these . And his solution to these problems tends to come down to of the -- more access , network organization .

I 'll only be getting the 7th one because it 's the one and I 've read this far so I might as well go the way . In books one through four the trio of Harry , Ron , and Hermione were characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day . Book 5 had them doing angsting and screaming than mystery solving , and more than day saving . Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a job miming the motions the characters would have done . This book Harry seemed to care more about romance . A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and moments on par with the of fanfiction ; which had no background or build up from books . A character from the background , whom Harry barely even notices all through the five books , is suddenly the most and girl in the school in fashion . characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance , none of which bore any revelance to plot or story . Harry also had a decline in morality and intelligence . The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one mistake after another . The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying , frozen in a position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose , under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly episode with Malfoy . As to the plot of the book . Poorly done . Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me . of the 'revealations ' in the book revealed nothing not already known or from information , and the culmination of what Harry was did n't amount to anything .

There is an preamble which states that the author ( s ) would not dedicate space to titles that are well known and well documented beyond the gaming community . This is an assumption about the public 's knowledge - both of video games and more-so it 's history of design . people that have heard of these games or seen their children watch the TV-spinoffs , likely would not be to identify what the games actually look ( ed ) like or anything about their play dynamics in a gaming environment . Even though Mario , Zelda , Pokemon , Donkey Kong , Defender , Asteroids , Missile Command , Frogger , etc . are mentioned briefly there are no images of reference for these games for us to ( a ) review and recognize , and ( b ) learn from . If this is supposed to be a sort of retrospective of the art of game design ( this is not about studies of techniques for rendering ) then why not show some of these classics as well as the ' classics ? The latter are better represented throughout the book but some of the choices are omissions are . The smattering of 'classics ' that are shown to be figurative than 'iconic ' which seems lacking to me in breadth and style of representation .

Lots of brooding scene-scapes and characters clearly inspired by countless masters as Boris Vallejo or much of the work seen in Heavy Metal . When there is mention of games that are actually considered art on display at museums , as `` Rez , '' -- we are not shown any images of it because space was taken up by two nearly renderings of Lara Croft ( ! ) in the spread . One has to ask oneself : what was the author/picture editor thinking ? The fact of the matter is that for all the talk in the intro there is to graphically show us where the industry came from verses where we are now . And from what I can tell , there is absolutely no mention of the explosion of games and unique designs being done in FLASH . Arguably one of the and least environments for making a game . Furthermore , all the games covered and talked about ( that I can tell ) are from very corporations and as tend to be slanted and biased in a number of regards .

Indeed , Michael Baigent et.al . have even sued Brown in court , charging him with plagiarizing their book . The ideas behind `` The Da Vinci Code '' have been exposed as completely bogus by historians . Obviously , this exposure affects `` Holy Blood , Holy Grail '' as well . This book is methodologically flawed . It claims that Jesus survived the crucifixion and sired children with Mary Magdalene . But if this happened , there should be documents telling us about it . There are essentialy only three views of Jesus : the Christian , the and the Gnostic . None of them includes the notion that Jesus married and had children with Mary Magdalene . It simply is n't to reject the documents in favor of texts of value , as Michael Baigent does . Of course , a conspiracy theorist might claim that the documentation is lacking to a cover-up . But such an argument , compelling as it may sound , is to the , who must work with the evidence , meager as it may be . A claim that can neither be proven or disproven is of help .

The idea that the secret of all times was revealed by a right-wing extremist only 40 years ago is very to take seriously .

It introduces the stage metaphor into sociology ; all of interaction is a performance on a stage . It 's how novel this metaphor is , but this is certianly its statement . The language used to present the ideas of the author is , like writing , unecessarily complicated . There are some problems with clarity and structure ; the book just doesnt have a feel for me . No background is presupposed , there is quoting from sources , footnotes , and ways to enter literature throught the book . So if you are in reading sociology , this is probably a place to start ( again , the language is thick and this may be it 's bane as an introduction ) . However , the book is misguided . The idea of viewing interaction as a performance on a stage is . The authors motives for saying this will make my position clearer . ( The following is a charicature of the author 's argument ) . There is certianly a amount of behavior which is directed towards people ( the audience ) in order for the audience to build an impression of the actor . Well , if it can happen here we can draw a with situations , infact all situations and therfore all of interaction is like a performance on a stage , `` All the world is not , of course , a stage , but the ways in which it isnt are to specify '' ( p 72 ) . The performances can either be with individuals , or groups of people , and they can be performing conciously or unconciously . ( end of charicature ) There are arguments , obviously , and the statement `` we can draw a with situations '' is of the content of the book , which i dont like to gloss over with a sentence . But the question here is , is the view worthwhile ? My answer : No . Social interaction is a phenomena that cant possibly be summed up with a signle metaphor . Yes , some interaction is like a performance , where indivudals are intentionally making impressions on one another . Yes , some behavior can arise from beliefs . However , interaction is exactly the way we see it , conciously controlled , , interaction with individuals ; it is not some kind of performance with the purpose of creating a `` reality '' . I hope my view of the book is so that the biases on the part of my review can be sorted out : the book is a waste of time . Where the author is , the statement is little than sense . Where the author goes outside of sense , he 's , sometimes plainly so . This book is part of the tradition in sociology of thinking that society pulls the wool over each individuals eyes , that reality is a construct with no purpose than control ( here the wool is the performance , and the control has to do with impressions ... but this quickly degenerates into an mess of assertions ) . There is no support given for of the claims . Where `` evidence '' is given , the evididence is so heavily intepreted that it fails to correspond to facts in the world but rather to facts about the views of the reporter . Where there is no correspondence to the world there is no truth . sources of sociology are cited , but this is more like bullying . Saying that some author , which also didnt have any support for his claims , agrees with you is just to bully your reader into acepting your claims . The claims in the book have no application in the world , but only serve to intepret situations differently , and in opinion , less correctly . Nothing said here will lead to predictions about behavior or a understanding of psychology . In , this isnt a study at all . My qualm with the book deserves its paragraph , the use of language . The example is the definitions given at the end of the introduction `` A performance may be defined as all of the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of the participants '' ( 15 ) . This is a definition . Me breathing while work is a performance , it changes the percentages of O2 and CO2 in the atmosphere near my co-workers . Me staring into space is a performance , people see me stare into space and are therefore . Infact , me simply existing is a performance , since my existance causes a effect on the participants , as well as influencing them to create beliefs about me existing . Its as if Goffman created a definition for performance which included all actions taken by any person , and then wrote a book about how all actions taken by any person fall under the category of performance . He didnt . He used a word that we associate with behavior ( performance ) and defined it in a way no one is used to . Then he used alot of word play to show that behavior has no substance , its all for the purpose of maintaining reality . I hope this very example shows the use of language that is to Goffman and sociology more generally . So an ode to sociology is in order ... actually no it isnt . Why wont this subject go away ? This book is an part of sociology , and it espouses the methods and style of researchers and writers by being an work within the tradition . The methods are ; the style is .

The book covers a variety of topics , some are puzzeling . While of the book bashes Barry Bonds is also bashes his ex-wife for being an dancer . I was pretty to read that , I was a fan of Pearlman but I thought he had more class then that . This book came out right after ( or because of ) Game of Shadows . This book here actually praises Game of Shadows while bashing Bonds for activities when 3 weeks after the book came out the writers of Book of Shadows are being subpeoned for illegally optaining information , guess that backfired Pearlman . In fact Game of Shadows may be taken off the shelves soon as well . The book uses sources ( there is a reference sheet in the back , of those articles all include quotes from sources ) , so its really to take alot of the harsh quotes that Bonds says seriously because it is . The book pretty discredits itself at the end when Pearlman proclaims that sports writers do not actually try or want to dig up dirt on people , they like to find stories . That quote alone will have any Bonds hater rolling eyes at the sheer stupidity of it . Sports writing has became essectially a tabliod now . Even Skip Bayless publically admitted that writers do that . So once again , the problem is that it fails to stay on ground .

As you read the book , the answer comes quickly , before you 're even very far into the `` A 's '' ... apparently he did n't . I was repeatedly disappointed by the cursory , often definitions which accompany of the 2000 terms Grimes presents . The line or two of each are accompanied by are often and sometimes down misleading . The introduction builds up the book as a tool to help we folk through the growing complexities of food buying and eating . In a world no longer dominated by a terms we are led to believe that this book will bridge the gap between cooking books ( say , from before 1990 ) and the state of culinaria . Why then are so of the terms defined in an , even archaic mind-set ? Take the term `` sugar '' . This book says it is `` or partially refined sugar '' , a definition all well and perhaps 200 years ago . Today brown sugar is almost always made from sugar with a molasses syrup and colorings added back to it - a very thing indeed , and Grimes should know the difference . The are examples in the vein . Additionally , Grimes give us `` food lists '' scattered periodically throughout the book but provides only support for the words used in them . For example , there is a list of Varieties of Apples . 48 varieties are listed but when one wants information on them it is often . `` Red Delicious '' apples have an definition in the `` R '' section but what about the more varieties like `` Sundowner '' , or `` Lodi '' apples ? No mention of them can be found in the book . There is also a list of `` Fish and Seafood '' but if you are intrigued by what the `` Geoduck '' or `` Sprat '' listed might be , you 're out of luck ( without running to a REAL dictionary ) .

I 've read a number of James Patterson books and while I 'm not a core fan , I 've enjoyed of them . I know this will outrage some Patterson readers but I 'm not much of a fan of Alex Cross who frankly I find as hell . As mediocre as Patterson often is as an author , readers should beware , London Bridges is especially . The reads like an abridgement , moving at a pace without ever generating any suspense . The premise is - criminals with names join forces to blackmail world leaders ( sounds like the plot for an Austin Powers movie - without any of the humour ) . Patterson is not remotely qualified to enter the thriller market . An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year does n't have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a thriller . The twists at the end - `` he 's the wolf - no , he 's the wolf - no , she 's the wolf - no ... . '' by the end , I just did n't care . James Patterson has written some crime novels but his fans should beware . Quantity , not quality seems to be Patterson 's priority these days . London Bridges is a mess from beginning to end .\", \"Reliance : Can we really Rely on Waldo ! Not his book , I Thought Waldo Lost in New York is more .

That is my experience with this book . For some reason , A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my school reading lists , and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt . So I picked it up . What a slog ! A book that might have been fascinating to its Revolution matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama . We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton , a character who you barely get to know , and root for Lucie Manette ... the highly paragon of goodness . The thing I liked about this book was how Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge . An admittedly concept .

Firstly , it is that the author 's holocaust experiences ( or more specifically , those of his family ) have left him with a interest in how the material in this book is presented . Secondly , there is a LOT of content to trawl through to get , in my opinion , a pieces of interesting material . Finally , the theme or accusation that without IBM the holocaust may not have happened , or would not have been so , is ( again in my opinion ) flawed . As the book shows , IBM certainly made it much easier for the Nazis to locate and identify Jews , it would not have been without IBM .

This book contains some information and some insights into the mass psychology of booms , bubbles , and busts . Prechter should have left it at that . Instead , he offers up predictions . mistake . This guy bases his forecasts on Fibonacci numbers and Elliott `` wave counts . '' He labels all market patterns so that they fit the Elliott Wave , pattern . If you see or waves than he does in any given market move , you just do n't understand that there can only be 5 waves to the top of a bull market . He 's imposing his theory on the market , but surprisingly enough , the market does n't care . It does whatever it wants , in however waves it wants , and Bob has been very frustrated at the market 's behavior lately . He got in his career , but it seems he 's been fairly consistently getting the market since missing the '87 crash . Any superstitution can `` seem '' to work if you only look at its happenstance accuracies and disregard its failures . Keep looking for numbers of waves and Fibonacci ratios and you 'll find what you 're looking for . Pick any set of numbers or patterns or wave counts , and you 'll find those too . The market does n't care about any of those things , though . It 's nothing than an aggregation of billlions of choices , which are influenced by an number of factors none of us can ever understand fully . University studies of investing methods have found that Elliott Wave , like , is no than stock selection . If Prechter had chosen the random method , he and his followers would at have a chance of keeping pace with the market . Unfortunately , he has been getting everything from the Dow , to oil ( he thought it was going to $ 10 ) , to gold ( he did n't think it could break $ 400 ) , to deflation ( the `` deflation '' scare ended shortly after this book came out ) WRONG in the couple of years . He apparently STILL believes that the Dow will go to 400 ( not 4,000 but FOUR HUNDRED ) because his charts tell him it should ( they 've been telling him that since about 1990 , actually ) . Prechter does n't understand demographics or economics or markets or the system , all of which render `` Dow 400 '' among the of forecasting absurdities -- unless you believe a asteroid will hit and wipe out two thirds of the population ( I do n't think Prechter is counting on that ) . Our economy may have a crisis soon , perhaps by the end of the decade . It will most likely be spurred on by inflation and rising interest rates . But it 's not happening now and it 's not happening in the way this author has been prematurely forecasting for over a decade . This book came out near the bottom of the stock bear market , just in time for a reader to short stocks as they began a bull market . How . While promoting the book , Prechter said it was `` '' that stocks would `` crash '' in 2003 . He said that 2003 would be `` the year yet '' for bears ( sellers ) . Late into 2003 , when it was that the market had proven him , Prechter declared on a radio show that by the end of 2004 , the Dow would `` certainly '' fall below 5,000 . again ! Since his Fibonacci turn dates and Elliott wave counts fail to portend the future , maybe next he 'll tell us he 's found the code to the stock market from the text count of Nostradamus ' writings . Bob Prechter could n't call the market if it was listed in the Yellow Pages . This guy could n't time the market if you gave him a stopwatch . He 's throwing out guesses and misleading people by describing them as `` '' and `` . '' He 's either a liar or a believer in his superstitions . In either case , he 's not .

It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become in the plot . Another disappointment is Koontz 's recycling of elements from novels : ( 1 ) plucky , highly disabled girl ( the protagonist in `` The Hideaway '' had almost deformities and personality ) , ( 2 ) devoted , canine companions , ( 3 ) guys driving around in pimped-out RVs , and ( 4 ) evil bioethicists . The Leilani character is patently . She conveniently has a genius IQ , but that does not make the absurdly manner in which she speaks any more . I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot . Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children , and this book is no exception . Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds ; the latter , however , does not justify his habit of making children talk like genius adults . Dean heaps the hardships on Leilani , with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker , Texas Ranger . In case you miss the anvils , you are supposed to really , really like her and fear for her safety . I do n't know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics , but he has a terribly view of the field , taking an sect of it to represent the viewpoint of the field . Further , he states times that these bioethics principles are being taught to students at universities ( who will have to pay for their involvement with bioethics ) -- as a student , I can assure you that this is patently . That Koontz could be so on a topic that directly relates to the motive is disconcerting and makes an already book even harder to swallow . The issue is Koontz 's near-deification of dogs , particularly Retrievers , which is a motif in his works . It is and unintentionally to an almost degree . His obsession with dogs and their powers borders on the ( and I like dogs ) . This novel probably features the most example of Koontz 's tendency to create overly , endings . Dean Koontz has written books than this one . Spend your money on one of his efforts\", \"The Careless Characterization of Helping Professionals McKnight 's concerns about communities ' dependency on assistance are , but disturbingly overstated in this book . In the end I felt McKnight 's trashing of the already government provision of services may not be altogether to communities . He sidesteps concerns of capital mobility and exploitation and the effects wrought by years of discrimination . debate over when and where and how programs can be is aside as well , since in McKnight 's picture , programs and the service providers are , in fact , the vilains and culprits for of what ails society . One of the fallacies that seems to be perpetuated in this book is that service professionals are not to be both and caring - the two are deemed mutually . Mcknights views resonate with employers ' caring - conveniently invoked every time a healthcare worker tries to claim she does care about patients but is still entitled to a living wage or , perhaps , health insurance . What is implied is that communities will readily and ably take up the reign of providing for themselves and their members when denied more services . It seems that communities had no problems before the programs to solve them came into being . In this , I think I see McKnight is invokeing an notion of an society at an time ; maybe his argument would have seemed more in a time when families were less geographically and may have constituted an unit , when the lived lives and were less themselves with more children to care for them , and the activities were more functionally . But McKnight 's model for today 's cure does n't seem to fit today 's conditions . On the hand , McKnights solutions may be the ones in a society where budget cuts and elimination of services seem the trend .\", \"Somebody Stop Me ... ... .. ... ... ..from reading Danielle Steel .

He tries to be all things to all people saying both that he believes in competencies but wants to put inquiry first . Also , his language is inflated , and lacking in specificity . For example , he believes in building up the world of `` representations '' [ term ] yet insists on `` performances of understanding '' [ another term ] . Also , he has respect for the learner and differences , yet he is concerned about the `` position '' or `` situation '' or class dynamics in which the learning takes place . Thus , he fails to do justice either to the individual or to class , race , or gender . The role of leadership in learning is wholly ignored ; and responsibility is not explored . In , it is extremely to pin down Prof. Gardner . It would be kind to say he is . I hope it 's just not thinking . However , we can discern that he has a obsession with beauty , truth , and goodness . Imagine -- the Holocaust is reduced to being an illustration of what goodness is or is not ! His treatment of these ideas is and . I do n't like to be so , but his writing about them does not deserve a analysis . When attacking E.D . Hirsch whom he calls the speaker for `` literacy , '' he sets up a man . He says that Hirsch 's school of thought has an belief in the `` rasa . '' Yet , I find nothing in Hirsch 's writings to indicate that he believes in a tabula rasa . Further , is Prof. Gardner really elitist than Hirsch as some have claimed ? I have found that the Harvard elite spend their lives trying to achieve and learn everything , and be on . Their lives are marked by ambition to the Nth degree ; yet , he debunks and content areas that traditionally have defined literacy at its . Thus , I find a dishonesty in Gardner 's presentation . Believe me , friends , I have taught students who have ideals , ideals and ideals , but know very , nor do they aspire to learn . If they have those ideals , and if they are and glib , will they be the leaders of tomorrow who are embraced by Prof. Gardner ? I find a tendency on Prof. Gardner 's part to oversimplify issues like the Holocaust , and to overcomplicate others like the nature of intelligence . The world is not waiting for the concept of intelligence to be . Am I oversimplifying when I think that there is something very awkward about saying that there is no difference in intelligence between Einstein and the custodian of my school ? Is this awkwardness because I am an elitist putting down the custodian ? Is it because of lack of intelligence that I am still in the grip of a definition of intelligence ? I do n't think so . Rather , we all know we are on each , and that everybody has some aptitudes or gifts they can express and be respected for , but trying to elevate this understanding to a level of truth or significance seems to me to be . Lastly , his writing style is a bit too fond of adjectives , and the book reads as a whole like It Takes A Village by Mrs. Clinton . The Disciplined Mind has a style that presents itself as being highly and , at the time , as , with sense . Yet , ultimately , the book is . As one Amazon reviewer states , Prof. Gardner is of himself . In this book , there is no discussion or emphasis placed on knowledge , justice , values , persistence , responsibility , or character development ... words which I find for a philosophy of education .\", \"BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER : A BOOK REVIEW BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER , the textbook currently used in my Introduction to Management class , does not effectively convey the fundamentals of business management . The book is structured around eight 'roles ' of an manager , and each role is broken down into a number of competencies that are functions of that role .

If they 'd wrapped it up with a plot around it , it 'd make a work of fiction\", \"A Analytical Review '' OF PARADISE AND POWER '' - BY ROBERT KAGAN '' Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus '' - apart from simply raising a eyebrows , this line by Robert Kagan author of `` Of Paradise And Power '' , has not only caught the attention of but managed to stir up a wave of discussions among the politicians and elites concerned with relations . Kagan 's thought provoking book became extremely and received acclaim for its analysis of the deteriorating US-Europe relationship , not to mention its catchy and phrases systematically introduced throughout the slender yet captivating book . Kagan introduces chapters in his book , in order to deconstruct the underlying issues which he claims are causes of the ever widening divide between US and Europe . In the chapter `` The Power Gap '' , Kagan starts from World War I to understand the aversiveness Europe displays towards and wars . He argues that while both the World Wars weakened Europe tremendously ; they helped the US emerge as a power . He further elaborates on the might of the US in the chapter that follows - `` Psychologies of Power and Weakness '' . Kagan explains how lack of power can not only psychologies and ideologies , but change perspectives as well . He claims Europe 's paucity of power compels it to not only threats but ignore them all together and at the time try and counterbalance the US force by constructing a world which is governed by and methods . This chapter culminates into `` Hyperpussiance '' , a chapter in which Kagan discusses details of Kosovo and Bosnia , highlighting Europe 's failure and America 's effectiveness in handling the situation . He finally presents his argument in the chapters `` The Post Modern Paradise '' and `` The World America Made '' where Kagan states , `` Europe 's evolution into its state occurred under the mantle of the U.S. security guarantee and could not have occurred without it . '' Casting doubts on Europe 's intentions , Kagan centers his argument on the growing policies of Europe and questions the validity of terms as ` ' in his chapter `` Is It Still ` The West ' '' ? Finally , it seems Kagan provides a solution to this problem of the US- Europe divide in his concluding chapter , `` Adjusting to Hegemony '' , by simply stating one line - `` the task for both Europeans and Americans is to readjust to the reality of hegemony '' . This extremely book , as compared to the issue it addresses needs analysis and some examining . There are issues to be addressed in Kagan 's analysis and one might not be completely satisfied with claims , reasonings or the manner in which such a grave and topic is handled . While there is a tone of underlying bias ( in contrast to the opinion of a view that the author holds ) , Kagan manages to miss out some facts and figures , not to mention stark paradoxes , and the essay lacks citings . To start with , let me point out the contradictions in Kagan 's arguments , the presence of which highly undermines his claims , leaving the reader in a dilemma of either argument . Kagan claims , `` Europe 's weakness has understandably produced a interest in building a world where strength and power matter than and power ... rules of behavior '' ( pg.37 ) . He goes on to say , - `` Since Europeans lack the capacity to undertake actions , either individually or collectively as ` Europe , ' it is that they should oppose allowing others to do that they can not do themselves . `` ( pg.38 ) in contrast to `` ... Europe today has the wealth and capability to make itself of a world power in terms if Europe wanted to become that kind of world power '' ( ) . Kagan contradicts his views , stating times that Europe is militarily , nor does it have the capacity to build up its forces yet at the time , puts forth an argument of Europe 's capabilities of increasing its defense spending and might to match the US . In the chapter , Psychologies of Power and Weakness , Kagan 's one claim contradicts another which is made in the chapter as the reasoning for both his claims seem to be absolutely . He first explains Europe 's tolerance for threats is to its weakness and the past , which it has suffered from . He then metaphorically explains it by giving the example of a man with a knife and the one with a rifle having interpretations of the word ` threat ' when confronting a bear ( pg.31 ) . But again Kagan himself feels Europe can become a power as and when it wishes to , when he says `` They could easily spend twice as as they are currently spending on defense if they believed it to do so '' ( pg.54 ) . So this forces me to ask a question , would one be mauled by a bear if one could produce a rifle to prevent this misfortune ? So is n't it quite that Europeans feel , not because they `` ... enjoy the ` ride ' they have gotten under the security umbrella over the six decades '' ( pg.54 ) , but rather because there was and is no threat at all ? With the use of phrases as `` The Axis of Evil '' and `` States '' ( pg.30 ) , which Kagan uses to describe Iraq and Iran , not to mention his references to ` Weapons of Mass Destruction ' ( which he uses as a pretext to the war in Iraq ) , which still seem to be for some reason , he seems to perplex me by blatantly ignoring his creation . While Kagan maintains that Iraq was a threat and the US perceived it as one while Europe did not , he might want to explain as to why , in 1997 , he ( Kagan was the Director of the Project for the New American Century ) signed a document which justifies American occupation of the Middle-East , irrespective of threats from Iraq or Iran . `` The United States has for decades sought to play a more role in Gulf security . While the conflict with Iraq provides the justification , the need for a force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein ... From an perspective , the value of bases would endure even should Saddam pass from the scene . Over the term , Iran may well prove as a threat to U.S. interests in the Gulf as Iraq has . And even should relations improve ; retaining forces in the region would still be an element in U.S. security strategy given the interests in the region . `` ( - Rebuilding America 's Defenses - *1 ) This forces me to conclude that either the author has resorted to ` cherry picking ' of evidence or he suffers from amnesia . Some of his reasoning , analysis and analogies seem to be too . When explaining action , one can not justify it by saying , `` When you have a hammer , all problems start to look like nails '' . The author speaks about the nation 's ( US 's ) willingness to go to war simply because it has the ability and the capacity to do so . Without discussing a need or providing reasons for the use of aggression , the author seems to be in justifying use of force , simply because one has it . One aspect Kagan leaves out in his analysis are the and aspects of the feud . While I have discussed some aspects later in the review , one must note that Kagan does not mention the Kyoto Protocol ( apart from Clinton 's negotiation of it ( pg.45 ) ) . The US withdrawal from the Protocol had created problems and divisions between the two giants ( www.climnet.org - *2 ) . While there were issues that fanned the growing fire , disagreements over the Missile treaty for example , which Kagan conveniently sweeps under the carpet , needed to be addressed if one is discussing relations ( www.bbcnews.com - *3 , 4 ) For a book which covers issues from the World War II decade ( occasionally going back to ancient philosophy ) to the issues , 72 citations , from which are simply explanations ( for examples , see 19 , 20 , 22 ) , seem to be alarmingly , especially with the absence of some ones and not to mention , citations which wrongly allude to facts . Kagan mentions , `` As ` some ' Europeans put it , the division of labor consisted of the United States making the dinner and the Europeans doing the dishes '' ( pg.23 ) , yet he does not refer to any source for this statement . He says , `` The majority of Europeans always believed that the threat ( if any ) posed by Saddam was more than the risk of removing him '' along with alleging statements like , `` The rehabilitation and reintegration of Saddam Hussein 's Iraq is precisely what they ( Europe ) sought '' ( pg.44 ) , and again gives no source for the origin of these beliefs . Strangely , he supports one of his claims by stating in his supra note.20 , pg.30 , `` for that matter , this is also the view commonly found in textbooks '' . One might not generally expect to see puerile purporting evidence in a analysis of relations . Kagan at times jumps back to Athenian times and has injected philosophies in his essay . He mentions a number of times how Americans see the world from a perspective while Europeans are followers of policies . Kagan seems to have overlooked the fact , that though Hobbes had described the state of nature as that of `` all against all '' , the reason Hobbes justifies a sovereignty is to ensure peace on earth . Kagan conveniently cites Hobbes ( Hobbes theory itself was flawed as philosophers termed it as ` Hobbes Dilemma ' ) to justify aggression , but no where in Hobbes ' theory is justified by the sovereign ( Leviathan - Ch.17 ) . There are some conclusions Kagan draws which seem to be beliefs of an idealist living in a world where politics is as as religion . He concludes that while the US was providing `` security '' to Europe after the Cold War , `` ... America 's power and willingness to assume responsibility for protecting nations ... '' ( pg.34 ) has given Europe the opportunity to build up economically . Kagan asserts his point when he says , `` Given America 's willingness to spend so money protecting them , Europeans would rather spend their money on welfare programs , vacations and workweeks '' ( pg.54 ) . These are presentations of facts , which are of subjective , ideologies . I would like to put forth two points in order to accentuate the fallacy of these two statements . First , America 's interest in Europe was not to provide it with security whether before or after the Cold War . One must not confuse the fact that measures taken to restrict the advance was purely for motives , rather than for the benefit of nations which were under the eye of the communist empire ( Kagan himself acknowledges the fact when he says , `` With the check of the power removed , the United States was to intervene practically whenever and wherever it chose ... '' ( pg26 ) ) . Second , when Kagan acknowledges that Europe which has a `` $ 9 trillion `` economy is in a position to support its welfare programs along with spending ; attributing the fact that Europe spends more on welfare , as he calls them `` free-riders '' , results in a faulty analysis . When I had mentioned earlier that Kagan chose to omit and ignore facts , the example of the Balkans , which the author has cited times in his book would seem most . Kosovo is one of the issues he discusses to bring US benevolence and incapacity . `` involvement in Kosovo or Bosnia was not based on calculations of a ` interest ' ... While Americans had a interest in stopping genocide and cleansing , ... the US had no ` interest ' at stake in the Balkans '' ( pg.50 ) , this is how Kagan sees it . Indeed stopping genocide was a concern , but was it the concern ? While Milosevic had very agreed to station NATO troops in Kosovo to stop the conflicts , none seem to have been in his offer ; they rather wanted access and control to all of Yugoslavia . The Rambouillet Accord , to which the Contact Group added an Appendix B on the day of the conference held at Paris , one must note was the reason for rejecting NATO troops , as it demanded Yugoslavia to surrender its autonomy and sovereignty . Yet , he does not mention of Milosevic agreeing to station NATO troops in Kosovo ( http : *5 ) . Some thing missing from Kagan 's book are the words `` Latin America '' and `` Africa '' . As seen above , Kagan believes America was spending its money protecting Europe and Europe alone from all the threats around the world , before and after the Cold War . But what baffles me to quite an extent is that not once does Kagan mention about any intervention in Latin America ( official or not ) , Africa or the Far East for that matter . Those who are well of the world around them , will be of America 's support for dictators and corrupt regimes throughout Latin America and the far East , Indonesia for example , which were for purposes alone or is it that the author is implying that the and countries were a threat to Europe , hence the interventions and no mention of them ? ( A timeline by Steven Kangas can be found on sites *6 , 7 , 8 ) There is one ` defect ' , as I put it , which undermines the argument of this book . Kagan 's vision approach , which refers to the word ` power ' only in terms of strength and capabilities , ultimately results in a dichotomy , which is the stumbling stone for his thesis . Kagan believes the world and in , Europe , is left with two options , that either they follow the US or be a audience . The reason he reaches this conclusion as I previously put it , is to his convergent view . `` Rather than viewing the US as a Gulliver tied down by threads '' , says Kagan , `` leaders should realize that they are hardly constrained at all , that Europe is not really of constraining the US '' . He reinforces this claim throughout his book ( see 33 , , 59 , 62 , etc ) . The author 's ignorance about hard-hitting , highly and facts has rendered blows to the validity of his claims . Kagan has committed errors here , by ignoring Europe 's strength , not but and indeed . With a population of 456,953,258 ( the CIA Fact Book *9 ) and still growing , the EU , leave aside Europe , can not be simply or brushed aside as a competitor or a culture . Europe is economically enough to trouble the US as and when it wants to , the problems over the genetically meat , banana dispute , steel industry debacle , Airbus-Boeing clash and , have all proved that Europe 's strength is much of a concern for the US . While I must point out a rank deletion , I believe this is ` the ' factor which is for arguing against all of Kagan 's thesis and arguments , and that is the Economy . Not once has he mentioned the deteriorating state of economy ( 2001 ) , even though problems did exist when he wrote this book . He seems to be blissfully and persists that America can sustain its exorbitant defense spending , `` ... the US can sustain its spending levels and its dominance far into the future '' . Strangely , the growing inflation rate , rising unemployment , stagflation , trends the economy was showing of heading towards a recession , were I believe dismissed as myths by the author ( for statistics see - www.bbcnews.com ; http : //wsws.org *10 , 11 ) . Also , Kagan 's solution suggest that , `` The answer is that Europe should ... . and build up its , even if only marginally '' , leaves me with a conundrum . Is Kagan implicating that Europe has no military at all or is it that he wants to begin a arms race , this time Cold War II ? Kagan must understand he is writing this book for publics and not simply those , whose ideologies are in tandem with his . Hence , I doubt most would disagree that the world should get into an arms race here , as we all know , there is no stopping to this if it once starts . While I have already discussed the effects of trade and economics ( which Kagan ignores ) on the relation , there is something I must point out before I end this review . Kagan , rather conveniently digresses of the topic , which is relationships , to justifying US hegemony in a fashion . While Americans themselves would probably not agree with Kagan 's ideology ( as the opinion and plummets - see polls from news sources *12 ) , leave Europeans or rest of the world , Kagan writes almost 15 pages to justify it . This was a rather conclusion to his book , where he thinks the solution to the ever widening divide is `` Adjusting to Hegemony '' . When Kagan says how ( statistics seem to abandon him ) Americans believe that by advancing their interest , they advance the interest of humanity , he sounds exuberantly and to drive the point home , he quotes Benjamin Franklin as saying - `` America 's cause is the cause of all mankind '' and again I must bring to the author 's notice , the recipient of these remarks is an audience , which is diverse , has its culture and heritage , beliefs and ideologies and has no reason to believe why their culture or beliefs are to any . An author of his stature must realize that it is relationships and not a grade bully that is being discussed . While he seems to take pride in saying that America has a `` go it alone '' attitude ( pg.39 , 99 ) , it does not abide by the UN Security Council ( pg.40 , 99 ) , takes action unilaterally of laws ( pg.45 , 61 , 99 ) , is justified in adopting ` standards ' ( pg.62 , 99 ) , he fails to fathom the gravity of the day ( or rather the day when he wrote this book ) situation and the growing unpopularity of policy around the world . While he sees Europe as an obstacle in the path of America 's goals , a observer would be than justified in pointing out that may be it is the US that hinders progress and efforts of the EU to establish a world which respects laws , rights , opinion and of all - peace . He fails to give an impartial , if not a solution to rid the world of this wedge as he weakly concludes his essay by saying , `` ... a understanding can still go a way '' . While have nothing but words of praise , as a one line summary by Francis Fukuyama calls it - `` '' ( a co-architect and signatory of the Rebuilding America 's Defense Project ) and according to Dr. Henry Kissinger , [ against whom charges of violations have been levied , who ironically , Kagan terms as a `` realist '' . See - http : //en.wikipedia.org ( for cases ) *13 ; http : //www.thenation.com ( for list of crimes ) *14 ] the book is a `` treatise '' which would `` shape the ( US-Europe relation ) discussion for years to come '' ; I do not particularly endorse it it . As I have already put forth data to show why the book lacks a argument , sane reasoning or evidence , though its lucid prose , comprehension and its articulate linking makes it a read , it barely digs into the problem or the solution , apart from scratching the surface , ` the surface ' . Indeed the book did create waves in the arena , which was probably to its timing , but I cast doubts on the claims that it would be `` discussed for years to come '' . *1 - http : //www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf *2 - http : //www.climnet.org/news/march2001.html *3 - http : //news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1383385.stm *4 - http : //212.58.226.30/1/hi/business/2052405.stm *5 - http : *6 - http : //www.atrocities.net/ *7 - home.att.net/~Resurgence/CIAtimeline.html *8 - www.serendipity.li/cia/cia_time.htm *9 - http : //www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ee.html *10 - http : *11 - http : //news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1263211.stm *12 - http : //www.michaelmoore.com/words/index.php *13 - http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger *14 - http : //www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames ? bid=3 pid=17\", \"Fast and Loose I suppose every author in this genre comes to the table with an agenda . That being said , in this book , Mr. DiLorenzo seems to play fast and with the facts ( or at with his conclusions ) . The flyleaf of this book promises `` research and documentation '' but at one reviewer has already pointed out some problems with this author 's research . That should raise a flag to anyone reading this book . Consider this : The author claims Lincoln was more in building an `` empire '' by centralizing Federal power than ending slavery . This implies Lincoln was premeditated in what he would do as President . I challenge anyone who believes that to read Lincoln 's words and , more importantly , examine his actions . This we know : Abraham Lincoln was a man and , as a person , his views on slavery changed during his years in life . He came to believe that slavery would not die out on its .

As someone very in exploration ( especially in the subways ) I wanted to check this book out upon hearing of it . After reading of these Amazon reviews though , I opted out of a purchase , and took it out of my Bronx library instead . Thank goodness as I only wasted time , and not any money . This book is a sham . It is obviously mostly fiction . And it 's fiction at that . The book is divided into chapters , each chapter a `` adventure . '' I read the subway one first , where the `` explorers '' take the 6 train around the loop at the end of the line , to see the City Hall Station , which opened in 1904 ( NYC 's station ) and closed in 1948 . The station is located on the loop of the 6 train , that makes the southbound trains go back up north after the stop , Brooklyn Bridge . First of all , anyone can go on this `` adventure . '' Just stay on the train at the stop , Brooklyn Bridge , and that 's it . Despite the author 's attempt to make this sound , no conductors walk through the train to see if anyone is on ( like they really care ) , just sit down . The author created some `` tourists '' that inadvertantly stayed on the 6 after the stop , and the author even tries to create some mystery by saying `` are we on the train ? '' Well , unless all those `` 6 '' signs that are lit all over the train are to read , then you probably got on the correct train . The author also fails to mention that the MTA used to give tours all the time through this station ( and others like the 18th street on the 6 and ) but stopped after 9-11 . This chapter was a joke . I started reading the chapters , and saw they were no . I then started to breeze through the book . One thing that is very - no photographs of the adventures are in the book at all . This , despite the fact that on page 67 the author states , `` Josh takes out his camera and snaps away at every pipe and puddle ... '' But no photos of their `` adventures '' are in the book . Why ? Because it 's fiction . There are photos of what they are supposed to be exploring , , that 's . There 's even one pic of one of these clowns hopping some fence somewhere , ooo . Buit no pics of the `` adventures . '' I guess `` Josh '' lost all those pictures when he went to CVS to have them developed . The thing is , you can save yourself a lot of time by just going and viewing pictures of these things for yourself .

And like of my book group , I was fairly disappointed by this novel from him . Originally published in Turkey in 1985 , the story is prefaced by an introduction in which one Faruk Darvinoglu purports to have discovered the manuscript in a archive . He then goes on to explain that parts of the story can be historically corroborated , but much of it ca n't . This should immediately alert the reader not to take everything in the book as it comes . Even more so if the reader knows that Darvinoglu is the protagonist of Pamuk 's book The House of Silence . tricks immediately bring to mind the works of Calvino , Borges , and their ilk . The plot is very : in the , a gentleman is captured by raiders and sold into slavery to an aspiring scholar who happens to look just like him . The two men then spend the decades cloistered together , engaged in investigations of astronomy , biology , engineering , and so on . These bring them to the attention of the Sultan ( based on Mehmet IV ) , whose patronage waxes and wanes , culminating in a attempt to construct a war machine . Along the way , their relationship swings back and forth , and is interrupted by an outbreak of the plague , whose outcome they are tasked with predicting . The book concludes with a section which will challenge the reader 's assumptions and calls into question everything that comes before it . Namely , are there two characters or are they just manifestations of two aspects of a person ? This all unfolds at a pace , and the two `` characters '' are ciphers . Their clashing of wills and ideas take up page after page , but the reader is always told about the conflict rather than shown it , and this makes for disengaging reading . Pamuk seems much less in storytelling or characters than in themes as the nature of identity , the collision of cultures , and the very nature of reality . But none of these are addressed in a way that is particularly or . The tension between East and West is handled in a fairly manner , as the master is obsessed with advances in science and technology , while the Sultan has a appetite for tales and soothsayers . This all comes across as a rather satire of the fluidity of character . In the end , this is not a particularly introduction to writer whom have compared to Eco , Calvino , Borges , Kafka , and Kundera . However , readers who enjoy highly works about self-identity with narrators may find this a satisfying read\", \"Waste of time Sorry , but I found this book a waste of time . I never did like the character - I found HER boring ! I laughed out when I read another say that `` this person escaped her life to be a secretary ? '' - point ! It was just so a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this `` '' life without really taking time to search her soul . Instead she befriends even more people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I could n't have cared what happened to her anyway ! After reading it ( book on tape ) I felt I had totally wasted my time . What a disappointment\", \"From Christianity ... To 'Churchianity' The author comes off as a whining , camper about having to grow up in what he considers a 'stifling ' church environment ; further apalled by the Church Founder 's belief , in that it ( the Worlwide Church Of God ) was God 's True Church through the ages , right on up to the 'end time ' . Feazell spends a amount of time giving his opinions on Herbert W. Armstrong , the Church 's teachings , and a trashing and somewhat of a misreprentation of the denomination as a whole , labeling it a 'cult ' ... and further damning its Pastor General as a `` '' , despite the Church 's works , publishing , Colleges and outreach for world peace over the seven decades under the leadership of H.W . Armstrong . Since Armstrong 's death in 1986 , Feazell and his cohort Joseph Tkach Jr. seem to be having a field day jumping up and down on his remains , and writing books on how it feels to be loosed from having to keep the Holy Days , , commandments ( which , in his estimation are now the suggestions ' ) and lifestyle of this Day Church Of God denomination . Mr. Feazell apparently does not speak for all the Church membership , as over 100,000 members left and formed Church Of God conferences throughout the United States ... and continuing the legacy and apostolic , Christian system of worship restored by Herbert W. Armstrong in 1927 . Recommended reading : `` Autobiography of Herbert W. Armstrong '' ; `` Mystery Of The Ages '' ; `` The Incredible Human Potential ''\", \"Its crap This is yet another book where anyone who passed a school bio class will know is .

John Katzenbach is an author and I had previously read and enjoyed another of his novels ( The Analyst ) , so I was surprised at how The Shadow Man was . The premise of the plot is that four very people , survivors of the Holecaust , believe they have seen the `` Shadow Man '' . The Shadow Man was a Jew who joined forces with the Nazis to find Jews that were hiding to avoid doom in concentration camps . These four people feared the Shadow Man than anything . When one of them is killed , a police detective named Simon Winter looks into who the Shadow Man is . Meanwhile , the Miami police are also investigating the death of the woman and have gangster as a suspect . Eventually , Winter and the police and the District Attourney join to hunt the Shadow Man , a man of evil . As the book villian , it was to fear a villian who was a killer 50 years ago but was now in his 70s . Also , this book barely touches on WWII , yet purports at times to be a about WWII . I 've read a lot of WWII novels , and this book would have been if it had been set in the 60s . But setting it day with citizens and the characters was n't too . It was n't primarily because I wondered where had the Shadow Man been all these years ? Why was he starting to kill now ? The Shadow Man had no motivation to kill . Finally , I realized I did n't like this book when I was skipping paragraphs at a time during the 20 pages . The book was like this with each character prone to long rambling thoughts that really added nothing to the story . If you take away the WWII angle , this novel is . The WWII angle adds some excitement , but there are probably thousands of books out there that relate the horror of WWII than this one does . The review from Publishers Weekly printed above summarizes my thoughts and deserves to be repeated ... '' Katzenbach ( Just Cause ) has some Holocaust and WWII vignettes and pretty cop-talk here , but the book is burdened by characterization , a pace , an , ending and a need for editing .\", 'Is it to sell this book This book was written in 2000 from events occuring in 1998 ! ! !

The representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill. What I 've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a sense of the park where the story took place with an appreciation for the beauty of the area . I doubt Anna spent than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park . Not only does she completely miss the character of the park but the park has no link to the story . The thing could have taken place in Chicago . I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them . This book , however , was truely . I 'll be much more about investing a part of my life in her book\", \"Dr. Narby 's Wild Ride Jeremy Narby 's The Cosmic Serpent : DNA and the Origins of Knowledge , started out decently enough with Narby reminiscing about his days doing field work in the Amazon Basin and from there he goes over some ideas regarding DNA and Myths but then all goes down hill as he suddenly becomes a follower of Intelligent Design and makes an all out attack on Evolution and Science itself . A number of Narby 's ideas regarding DNA and Shamanism are intriguing enough but he has apparently decided that all Shamanism is based on Molecular Biology , while he freely admits that he is being very reductionist on this point , I still see problems with his view that Shamanism is based on Molecular Biology at heart . His argument mostly surrounds the symbol of the Serpent/Dragon which is in mythologies often with connections to water and associations with twins . He decides that this is in actually a representation of DNA as viewed by Shamans and believes that all serpents in mythology and visions are actually DNA . Since DNA emits photons and this has been shown to possibly play a part in cell communication ( along with the communication ) Narby believes that in trances the shaman becomes to see the light emitted by DNA ( which often show up as snakes ) and the shaman communicates with the bits of DNA ( which is ) and the linked network of DNA based life . As justification for this argument he points out that some groups hold that spirits are beings of pure light , to him this is almost literally as the spirits are actually DNA and communicate through as `` spirits '' . From there he goes on to say that all ladders , staircases , and ropes in quests are representations of DNA and when the shaman uses them he is travelling along DNA and similarly when the shaman goes to the underworld he is sinking down to the world of Molecular Biology ( although since one can apparently work with and see DNA in the world one must ask why one would need to shrink down ) . While these views might make for some discussion about some practices , Narby seems to have ignored the aspects of visions and quests and any elements than snakes or things that just happen to be and . Given Narby 's view of spirits as DNA one must ask what helpers/allies are ? Is someone 's guides DNA in some bacteria on my hand ? Will I kill Yahweh by washing my hands with soap ( maybe that 's why Jesus decided that washing one 's hands was ! ) ? A lot of his proof is like the proof of Erich von D�niken except that where D�niken saw aliens and spacecraft , Narby sees DNA and Molecules . Take for example this D�niken-esque proof from the book : '' The second was a rock painting of the Rainbow Snake . I looked at it more closely and saw two things : All around the serpent there were sorts of chromosomes , in their `` U '' shape , and underneath it there was a kind of ladder ! '' ( p. 79 ) By Chapter 10 , entitled Biology 's Blind Spot , Narby has decided that Evolution is and all of Science must be toppled . This bit seems to have come out of nowhere like someone spliced a Design rant into a book where it did n't belong and as with all Pro-ID and Creationist literature we get the faulty attacks again and again . Attacks as Evolution being based on a argument because the most species survive to spread their genes and therefore are . Yes , that is the definition of fitness , and sometimes the basis of things start as tautologies as the Theory of Gravity but like Gravity Natural Selection and evolution is and by looking at it 's power . Population genetics and mathematics shows clearly that selection is very and has so far not been falsified . Similarly , we can also look at the fossil record in strata for evidence of change over time . After that attack Narby then attacks the Central Dogma ( Which is how transcription of DNA to proteins works ) by misinterpreting what Francis Crick meant . Crick never meant the word Dogma in Central Dogma to be taken in the sense it is used in religion instead he meant it as a joke name for a hypothesis that he had at the time evidence for . Narby misinterprets Crick 's joke to argue that evolution is apparently Faith based , since this argument has no basis in reality it falls immediately . He then argues that ants and animals are fully because they do amazing things that seem to require forethought and they tap into DNA like shamans to do things . animals are and may have consciousness but ants are pretty . One is reminded of Edward Selous and others ' ideas about thought-transference to explain how flocks of birds move and how ants and termites build hives , as it turns out birds flocking behaviour operates on rules ( clustering , maintaining speed , and distance ) and so are Ant Nesting behaviours . One proof of this is to put food just out of the reach of ants , and some dirt underneath , while they understand how to move earth and tunnel they will never purposely move earth to build ramps , bridges , or tunnels to reach a goal . The birds who flew in flocks and the ancestors of ants who had developed nesting behaviour managed to survive and so these behaviours somehow became instincts and persisted . Now Narby makes the extremely argument that life is too complicated to be determined by chance alone , and he is on this matter . Too there is than chance guiding evolution , we also have Natural Selection guiding the process , to quote Richard Dawkins : `` results from the survival of randomly varying replicators . '' The combinations which work and and are kept in the population . Narby argues `` How can a telephone directory of information emerge from random processes ? '' ( P. 142 ) to answer this I wish to quote a bit of Michael Shermer 's 25 Creationists ' Arguments and 25 Evolutionists ' Answers which nicely illustrates how selection can produce Shakespeare 's Hamlet quickly from letters : '' Natural selection is not `` random '' nor does it operate by `` chance . '' selection preserves the gains and eradicates the mistakes . The eye evolved from a , cell into the eye of today through hundreds if not thousands of steps , of which still exist in nature . In order for the monkey to type the 13 letters of Hamlet 's soliloquy by chance , it would take 26 to the power of 13 number of trials for success . This is 16 times as as the number of seconds that have elapsed in the lifetime of the system . But if each letter is preserved and each letter eradicated , the process operates much faster . How ? Richard Hardison constructed a computer program in which letters were `` selected '' for or against , and it took an average of only 335.2 trials to produce the sequence of letters TOBEORNOTTOBE . This takes the computer than 90 seconds . The play can be done in about 4.5 days ! '' Narby also tries to argue that gaps in the fossil record as in evolution and places where there are or no forms indicate that evolution has not occurred . This however just means that in this instance there are gaps in the fossil record because the fossils have not been found yet . Narby also points to the seemingly appearance of species in the fossil record as an argument against evolution . Apparently Narby has never heard of Punctuated Equilibrium . Narby stunningly also tries to argue that because portions of DNA is over species that this somehow indicates design , unfortunately for Narby a lot of these sequences of DNA code for the processes of life . A human who could n't cope with oxygen or a fox which could not metabolize energy would not long in this world . The fact that these sequences are is actually a point for evolution because the processes have been preserved and we even see structures in animals even when it is not or as digits in the fins of dolphins or the appendix in humans . Finally , we come back circle to his argument about Natural Selection being a form of logic and he ties to paint Evolution as ( No , we can test it 's predictions in fields as Genetics and Palaeontology ) and being denounce by an increasing number of scientists ( not at all ) . All in all while Narby has some nuggets of information and ideas in The Cosmic Serpent he ultimately seems to squander these ideas by jumping around in directions and to strange conclusions based on very evidence\", \"Too Out of Touch Herself She wastes the chapters , and my time , going to extremes with consultants that only someone who does n't deserve to be hired would use .

While I have only read a selection of her work , in these essays , quot ; Against Interpretation quot ; being the example , Sontag emerges as a , ignoramus . In her invective , Sontag ignores ( or is just to understand ) two facts . First , some works of art and theory are to understand ( in varying degrees ) without the help of interpretation . Sontag 's analysis of the supposed ruination of the works of Kafka by interpretation demonstrates that not only is she among this crowd , she has clearly reached and of heights . Second , Sontag ignores the fact that works of art in languages can not be understood in translation without the help of interpretation and criticism that demonstrates the extent to which aspects of a culture are imbedded in the language . This could n't possibly be than in poetry . Weinberger 's quot ; Nineteen Ways of Looking at Wang Wei quot ; , which adroitly considers the subject , had n't been released when Sontag published this essay but it probably would n't have made a difference . What was she thinking ? The only aspect of the essay ( and why I give it 2 stars instead of 1 or zero ) is the fact that it has given me opportunity to win arguments against individuals who are flawed in their thinking enough to enjoy Sontag 's writing\", \"Better off reading his column in women 's magazines I stumbled across this book by accident at my library and decided what the heck , all those millions reading Gray 's franchise ca n't be . Plus , I 've seen Gray on Larry King once , and he seemed like a and guy . This book , though , promising in its intro to be `` '' , touched of my than my nerves . Now , I am not above accepting bedroom advice where it 's warranted ( for instance , it is thanks to Dr. Gray that I finally made sense of that night years ago when my husband slept on the couch after a fight caused by my criticizing a movie we 'd just went to see ) . But Gray 's generalizations , dumbing down of issues and sharing his sex life with his wife Bonnie were mostly , and I suspect that the passages I found funny were involuntarily so . Although I 'm the to admit that women love compliments , Gray 's suggestions , as displayed in 10-lists of things to say ( and , occasionally , what not to say ) were a tidbit too ( ever wonder how combinations you can play with the phrase `` your breasts are '' ? Read the book ! ) . Almost as enlightening was the tip on how , while getting to the part , the man should pull the woman 's panties `` up her crack '' ( a.k.a . give her a plain wedgie -- no joke ) . And , do n't miss the one where the Mongolian woman pulls a flag at mast when she 's in the mood and at half when she 's not ( or maybe it was colors , I could n't read clearly through my tears -- no offense to the people ! ) . More were the recurring ( and very ) assumptions that a woman always needs 10 or times more cajoling into sex than a man ( in ways , be it foreplay , flowers or the seduction line hit lists ) , that a man always comes ( and too quickly , of course ) , and that you need constantly acrobatics in the bedroom , or your ( otherwise mutually and , I wonder ? ) approach will become a `` turn-off '' . Bottom line ( no pun intended ) : if you want some light and ( ! ) guidance , the book is not too , but if it is `` bedroom skills '' ( Gray said that ! ) that you 're after , you 're off digging out that Erica Jong or even any pulp .\", 'yea you guys congrats on your victory in eight and a half decades', \"Did n't like the writing style at all I have never read one of Johansen 's books and after reading this one , I 'm not to read another .

Exclamations as `` heaven '' and `` lord '' were repeated over and over again by all characters throughout the book , which does n't seem to fit with the rest of their tone ( it would suit my grandma , however ) . As another reviewer said , the mystery of why Daisy would n't leave Geneva was n't particularly - if she really wanted Jason to leave she could have just told him .

While Nathan and Sophie are both , characters with obstacles , Stingo , the narrator , is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his to .

And in the end while the structure of narrator/observer seems like a choice in the abstract , the narrator and his lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of Nathan and Sophie . In the end , the narrator never even approaches the question in my mind : why did Sophie so quickly choose Eva to die rather than Jan ? A lack of understanding of what would happen to the girl ? A blind panic ? A preference for her son , the sort of preference parents may harbor that is never because we are never asked to choose ?

As a , chef and baker , I am also an avid baking and cookbook collector . After seeing that this book won and the James Beard and the 'IACP Cookbook of the Year ' awards -both prominently displayed on the cover of this book- and after reading the 'too to be true'-reviews on Amazon -some reviewers sound so and in trance as if Peter Reinhart is the Jesus Christ of Bread- I finally decided to buy this book . What a dissappointment ! For all those blindly following Reinhart as he were the Saviour of True Bread , wake up ! Reinhart 's book is simply flawed . Compared to books , it 's even a book . But one that is luxuriously packaged . A lot of air . And it 's not because of the info and bread knowledge in it , but because of the super luxuriously editing . This is a book for book enthousiasts , not for bakers , or home . I see baking and cookbooks mainly as working tools , as information and inspiration . Not as eye candy . If you want pictures , buy an art book . A book on baking bread with these awards behind it , should give you tons of info about ingredients and techniques , insights , an appetite for baking , info , the and tested developments in technique ... What you get here is a fluffed up egotrip . 47 formulas and bread info packaged into a shining $ publishing hype . Do n't get me : this is a , book . But one you do n't use in the kitchen , and certainly do n't smudge with butter but put on the coffee table in the living room to impress guests and have polite conversations about . But as a source of information or enlightening up to date bread knowledge , giving pointers about using ingredients combined with bread baking techniques , as a working tool sweating near the oven at home or at a bakery , compared to books , this book fails miserably . But it has a lay out . Jeff Hamelmans 'Bread , a Book of Techniques ' and Rose Beranbaums 'Bread Bible ' give the readers much more info and insight into baking . They talk more about the 'bread ' . And not about themselves like Peter Reinhart clearly relishes . Mr Reinhart clearly sees himself as so and interesting a person that we read in this book about his wife and their sightseeing in Paris . How about the bread info , the kneading , rising , baking , and techniques info ? I honestly prefer bakers who pass on their baking knowledge clearly without having to read at which hotel room they stayedin . Bakers with ego 's that think that readers of a Bread Baking book are more in the shopping experiences of the wife during ' a trip ' to bakers on which she accompanied him , than in another bread formula 's , should work in shobizz , not in a bakery or a school . Big ego 's with more talk than substance galore in the food industry . Reinart is , judging by this book , sadly also one of them . I do n't see in a 1000 years Rose Beranbaum in one of her books rambling on about her husbands color of ties or Jeff Hamelman writing in a book about the time he spent with his wife in Paris . Mr.Reinhart : your readers forked out $ for bread info , not your travel experiences . As you as a teachers no doubts sometimes say to a pupil : Stay with the subject ! And the subject of this book , for which I paid is and Baking . If we want to know about your life , we 'll read an interview in People , if they find you enough . Peter Reinharts 'The Bread Baker 's Apprentice ' as a Book ' is simply a marketing creation . Smartly edited , but way too on substance . There is not information on bread . : there is not info at all ! In for $ , you get exactly 47 formulas on 307 pages of which 2 color photo pages are simply ads for books by Ten Speed Press , the editor or this book . Compared to Beranbaums 640 pages , Hamelmans 400 plus pages , that is a difference for a price . With Reinharts book , you get a lot of shining surface that in Bread books is filled with info . As a buyer of this book , you also pay for page and color pictures that are filler . See 3 , 6 , 26 ... And why is the model Fumie on the cover of a book and not Reinhart himself or even ... bread alone ? With Reinharts book they will no doubt put Kate Moss in an apron and a bakers vest . Package the air enough and the readers will swallow it and fork out the $ . Never mind the content . Let 's talk a bit about the formula 's . That should be an part of a baking book , right ? And they should be and tuned , right ? Sadly to say : nothing or here . Some are n't even tuned . And baking is all about tuning . , almost all the formula 's can be found in books . And , insulting for a buyer of this book , a lot of the 47 formulas ( Reinhart uses this word because 'recipe ' propably does n't fit into the marketing of this baking book ) in this book are rehashed or directly derived from Reinharts book 'Crust and Crumb ' . Clever marketing and ba-da-bing ! By the way , 'Crust and Crumb ' has been reedited in 2006 . At a price , I admit . So if you want your dose of Reinhart at a price without the pomp , sc�nes of a marriage , without Peter Reinharts comment on the Eiffel tower so to speak ... buy 'Crust and Crumb ' and leave this luxuriously edited egotrip on the shelves . But before I buy I would also first flip through Beranbaums and Hamelmans bread books in the bookshop or in the Amazon shop . As for this book , you should ask yourself : 'Do I want a bread book or a book ? ' . Taking in consideration all the egostroking in this book and in reviews , as a baking book for the world market , this book is almost . The accepted working standard in baking is weight . Like it or not , but that 's a fact . You weigh your ingredients carefully by grams , kilo 's etc . Reinhart visited bakers Poilane and Gosselin , clearly admires them and aspires to reach their level of baking . I do n't think that Poilane measures in cups and ounces ! But even then , let Reinhart measure in cups for the home market . But then have the decency to add the equivalent in the formula 's itself for the rest of the world . This guy goes on and on about his wish to bake inspired bread like ciabatta , fougasse ... About a Worldwide Bread Revolution ! And then he refuses to use the most tool to make these breads : the language , the weight system . Rose Beranbaum places the to the cups/ounces . It 's a as that . Bread is a world food , so use the world standard for baking . If not , market your book mainly to the USA market and be honest and about that . And do n't give us that inflated air about a Worldwide Bread Revolution without using the worldwide accepted working standard , the wieght system ! This flaw makes the book almost for bakers outside the USA . The Worldwide Bread Revolution wo n't be for if we have to use this book worldwide ! point : Reinhart advocates yeast over pressed yeast . Every baker worth his salt ( or yeast ) will tell you that yeast gives a far taste , volume and texture . Yeast is a organism . As yeast ' it has been dried and put on the shelves for God knows how . It 's like you force a just woken up coma-patient , that has been for months , years ... to run a marathon . Fresh , pressed yeast is still and its taste and texture are a world of difference compared to 'instant ' ( aka dried ) yeast . Try the difference between yeast and yeast for taste and texture and fully developed rising at home , and judge for yourself . To place yeast on the level as yeast is for someone like Reinhart who spends days on his pre ferments ! For back up , you can always read the recently translated book of world renowed food scientist Herve This Gastronomy , Exploring the Science of Flavor ' ( Columbia University Press 2006 ) . And it gets . Reinhart frequently uses shortening instead of butter or oil in his breads . If Poilane hears this , he 'll drop ! Every baker knows that even a amount of butter gives a much taste and texture than shortening . Shortening produces a taste and a slimy , mouthfeel . Not to talk about health . shortening is of trans fats which are much more than butter fat . Read Harvard 's nutrition professor Walter Willets book : 'Eat , Drink and be Healthy ' ( Press 2001 ) . New York has already picked this info up . food writer and teacher Reinhart has n't or does n't care . For instance , Reinhart proudly declares -not as a joke- that in bread you can use shortening instead of oil . In Bread ! Come on , let 's be . And this guy teaches at the Culinary Institute of America ! It 's like he is advocating spam to put on the BBQ instead of beef ! If that is the standard of baking that Reinhart uses , he 'll have to wait a time to reach the standards of a Poilane . Then there is Reinharts Hygi�ne Problem . There is an standard for hygiene in food called the Hazzard Analysis of Critical Control Points ( HACCP ) . Reinhart as a tutor and teacher must no doubt know the HACCP by heart . The thing in hygiene that an apprentice baker learns , is that before even touching ingredients , he must remove all the rings on his fingers . Because the place underneath a wedding band for instance , is the place where the filth gathers and bacteria feast . And kneading dough with all that filth underneath a wedding band that you keep on , is not only very for the health of customers , it is simply not done for a baker . I like my bread without filth baked in , thank you very much ! In the school where I earned my diplome in baking , if a student had a ring on during class , he had to leave the class immediately and he lost points for his exam . Yet we see teacher and Bread Book Author Reinhart kneading dough WITH HIS WEDDING BAND ON ! See 36-37 , 82-83 , 255 , 245 ... in a ' baking book . And all the more in an book that won the James Beard and IACP awards ! Has anyone of the juries of the James Beard Foundation and the IACP , any knowledge of food hygiene ? Has nobody seen this sin against food hygi�ne in a so Bread Book ' ? One thing , for a book that pretends to be world class , there is no word about bread . Not one formula . And this while and people are to gluten ( protein in flour ) . To end on a note , one thing I found in this coffee table book , was his 55 pages with the 12 stages of bread . But , reviewers , you can find all this info and , and explained clearly , and to the point , in Hamelmans 'Bread ' and Beranbaums 'Bread Bible ' . And it does n't take 55 pages of quality shining paper . Peter , take out all the space , learn to write clearly and to the point , and you can say the thing in 20 pages . Which leaves you 35 pages for formula 's for example . But if you have n't any formula 's left or are preparing a book , then , yes , by all means stretch the 12 stages of bread to 55 scarcely printed pages instead of 20 . Why make it if you can make it seem , impress your not so readers and in doing so stroking your ego ? So despite all the hoopla , hyped reviews , praise and awards , this is simply a too , show off-book . It 's like the tale of King with no Clothes on ' . Somebody has to yell : 'Hey , wait a minute !

As a science fiction film , the Annie Hall is a disappointment . Whatever merits these movies might have , there are definitely areas that they are lacking . brings me to The Rough Guide to Cult Movies : as a reference book , it is highly . What 's is that Annie Hall fails as sci-fi because it does n't try to be that genre ; The Rough Guide fails at the very it aspires to . Which is too , because it is often an read . The failure starts at the beginning of the book with a definition of cult movies that is so as to be . We then a series of chapters representing `` genres '' , some of which are ( science fiction , westerns , horror ) , some of which are ( Animals , Food , Nuns ) and some of which are not even genres ( dubbed , , ) . After this , we get topics that are thrown in without rhyme or reason , as a list of movie grosses followed by movie trivia . The movie descriptions are often , although there are errors ( as misstating Geoffrey Rush 's role in Pirates of the Caribbean ) , even omissions ( every reader will find his ; one example is that Unforgiven is missing from Westerns ) and plenty of movies that are really miscategorized but seem only placed in a genre to fill it out . What saves this book is , even though it fails as a reference book , it is nonetheless . I am therefore giving this two stars instead of one . It 's a rather book , especially if you want to learn about movies , but if you do pick it up , it is probably the most book that you 're ever to read .\", \"hatred with sounding documentation Another farce to feed hatred with sounding documentation ...

The book starts in 1936 , although people know that the march to war really began with the seizure of Manchuria in 1932 . The author continually repeats the refrain that `` Americans do n't understand the mentality and culture '' , and it was this `` misunderstanding '' that led to the war . It is that Toland defines the term `` gekokujo '' as being some sort of `` insubordination '' that led to the Kwantung Army to feel it could move , presumably without orders from Tokyo , into Manchuria . However , Toland does not explain how this could happen . There is description of the power structure in Japan , we do know that there was some attempt to create democracy , but there were also the oligarchs who had power , plus the hierarchy . Somehow , the took control in the 1930 's , but Toland does n't really say how . He describes in detail the `` 2/26 '' Uprising of officers in 1936 , and how they were to kill without compunction , and how they were , yet we are then told that they OPPOSED expansion into China , and that the repression of this coup attempt would lead to an expanded war in China . I must say I do n't understand this at all ... Toland potrays them as fanatics , yet they seem to be `` the guys '' . Were n't those who supported expansion into China also fanatics ? This is left totally . Toland then goes on to describe the `` Incident at the Marco Polo Bridge '' in 1937 near Peking ( Beijing ) which led to the invasion of China . Toland says the government in Tokyo , again , had nothing to do with it , in fact both the Chinese and commanders on the spot tried to calm things down , but some `` hotheads '' ( possibly Chinese Communists ) kept inflaming the situation . Somehow ( without Toland telling us how ) , a decision is made by someone ( not necessarily the `` '' Prime Minister Prince Konoye ) to mount a invasion of China . An impression is left by Toland that the Chinese , , the Koumintang government of Chiang Kai-shek was and . All I know is that that Marco Polo Bridge is within China , and it is that the Chinese would resent the presence there . After this , we move on to the atrocities of the `` Rape of Nanking '' , which again , according to Toland , `` somehow '' happens , ( Toland does admit that there were atrocities and between 200,000 and 300,000 Chinese were butchered by their `` brother Asians '' who claimed to be liberating them ( ? ) ) . Toland says the commander at Nanking did not order any behavior , nor again , did the government in Tokyo . How then do thousands of supposedly disciplined troops suddenly get it into their heads to do things ? Toland does n't give us a clue , than his statement that `` westerners do n't understand the '' . Toland also , in a way , tries to claim that opposition to expansion into China was `` '' because of Colonialism in East Asia ( US in the Philippines ; Britain in Hong Kong , Malaya , Burma , India ; Dutch in East Indies ; French in Indochina ) , however , by the 1930 's the US had already agreed to give the Philippines independence and the were beginning to wind down the Raj in India was setting up an government , so it was that Colonialism was already on its way out before the war .

While I agree that students must learn to differentiate one property/theorem/rule/postulate from another , it does n't make sense that , instead of some , diagrams are .

The author speaks with a crusader 's zeal and with so detail that the reader can visualize these tenements , these streets , and these people as if they were living today . This is a and moving portrayal of the lives of the men , the women and the children that inhabit these neighborhoods of New York City in the 1800s . He so graphically describes the filth , the sunless and airless rooms , the crowding , and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart . Riis has a concern for the situation and understands these people 's plight . His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery . He , for the part , blames the landlords for these conditions : `` How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man . '' ( p. 266 ) . He laments that the tenement is three quarters for the misery of the . Then , after his discourse , he offers three concrete cures for these conditions , something that authors forget when they are enlightening readers . Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says , `` If this book shall have borne ever so a hand in garnering a harvest of justice , it has served its purpose . '' The author apparently succeeded with his purpose , because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us : `` This book helped bring about revisions in the housing codes of the U. S . cities . '' How does this book relate to adult education ? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s , are we to understand that education took a seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years ? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem . `` Thus the matter resolves itself once more into a question of education , all the more because these people are , miserably almost to a man . '' ( p. 147 ) . He does not forget that this `` education '' is not only for the people , but also for the landlords . `` Clearly , it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant . '' ( p. 270 ) . Riis ' almost language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity . `` It is a fight in which vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society . '' ( p. 233 ) . The relation of this book to the units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the cornerstones of a society . Although this book was in its detail , it was to read while at the time enlightening . I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the races . In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem ; constantly hitting the reader with lists of places and people from another era . Read these names out loud and feel their rhythm : Jewtown , Bandit 's Roost , Double Alley , The Bowery , The Bloody Sixth Ward , The Fourth , Fifth and Tenth Wards , Blindman 's Alley , The Bend , The Battery , Little Italy , The Quarter , Hell 's Kitchen , The West Side , Bottle Alley , Frog Hollow , Poverty Gap , Murderer 's Alley , Gotham Court , The Old Brewery , Old Africa , Potter 's Field , Blackwell 's Island Asylum , Rogues ' Gallery , Penitentiary Row , Chinatown . The list goes on . To someone reared in America , this sounds like a song about another country . Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City : Chinaman ( he ca n't be taught ) , ( Chinese ( coolie -- business ) , Jew ( coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling ) , Jew , Jew ( money is their God ) , Bohemian ( , but thrifty ) , Blacks ( like to gamble , but they are ) , Greek , Hebrews ( tailors , all of them ) , Dutchman , Irish ( like to drink and have funerals ) , ( order loving ) , , Pasquales , Russian , Italian ( a born gambler ; lighthearted and gay ) , Swamp Angel ( thieves ) , Street Arabs ( army of boys ) , Tramps and Toughs ( the world owes them a living ) , and the Celtics . I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis ' comments about every race . I noticed one interesting similarity between the 1800s and the day . Riis says that the gap between the classes is widening . I hear people talking about the growing differences between the and the often these days . Does every generation think that is happening in their time ? Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City ` tenements , but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for change . It is a reminder to show us how the circumstances can become when man 's greed overrides his concern for dignity .\", \"Damaged book The package the book came in was smashed .

I 've never read the ( or any of the parts of the trilogy ) , so I ca n't comment on Karasik and Mazzicchelli 's adaptation . However , I can say that since I 'm not particularly fond of existentialist or literature ( those two terms being the most shorthand for Auster 's story ) , this really did n't do anything for me at all . The story is basically an exercise in metafiction , and if you like that stuff , -- I do not . It is dressed up ( at initially ) in the mystery genre , but that 's just dressing . ( There 's a legacy , especially in France , of cloaking novels and films of ideas in trappings ( for example Alain Robbe-Grillet 's two books The Erasers and The Voyeur , or the films of Jean-Pierre Melville . ) The story begins fairly straightforwardly : a writer of potboiler mysteries named Daniel Quinn lives in New York on his since the death of his wife and son . A stranger calls him and thinks Quinn is a detective named Paul Auster and begs him to to take his case . ( The writer Paul Auster , and his family , shows up for one scene -- it 's that kind of book . ) Quinn meets with the man , who was raised in rather harrowing circumstances by his professor father , who was seeking to discover the language of God . The father has been released from jail and Quinn is supposed to keep an eye on him and report . Everything starts to derail when he loses track of both the man he 's been following , and his clients . He spends months watching the building and going . Once he realizes they 've disappeared , he finds his life has disappeared as well . Obviously this is all somewhat about identity , but it 's about fun stuff like language , representation , and subjects ( as are the two parts of the trilogy , which involve a man spying on someone , and yet another disappearance ) . It has to be said that the artwork does an job of treating the bizarro world Auster has thrust his characters into . The simple , and inking is a match to the material , especially when the representations become less and more . However , if your taste runs more toward things like plots and characters , this is probably not for you . Fans of Auster may enjoy this , but fans of the form are probably going to be much .\", \"Dry , boring and Paul Auster 's City of Glass is perhaps the read I 've experienced . The story moves at a pace that would make a snail ; the murder mystery plot is as as air and hardly resolves itself ; we spend way too waking hours with the character sulking around his apartment staring into a toilet bowl in which he has just defficated -- I kid you not . The part of this novel is the end . I read with fervor to get to the end in hopes that the author would have the talent to tie everything together and make this experience somewhat ; however , I was utterly and discustingly dissapointed beyond my dreams . To all the reviewers and critics who claim this book is a , tour de-force , I beg wholeheartedly with my very life to differ . I believe the author had no thoughts in mind , had no direction when writing this disgrace of a work and it saddens me to see an , piece of fiction with one or two plot devices , gather praise . Like a Rorschach image you can see life , love , death , a myriad of symbols , and if you would like to believe that the person who put that ink blot on the page intended you to see all of that depth , and dwell in that depth -- coming to conclusions and reflecting ultimately on your life , well , then , for you . But in reality , the person that made that Rorschach for you is Auster , and he just ambigoulsy splatted some ink on the pages before you with no ryhme or reason and you All bought it ... hook line and sinker . This novel is an exercise in an authors ability to take us nowhere , show us on the way and still praise , despite an ending which is of the work , in that it plain and simply : sucks\", \"No help at all This book did not teach me anything and was a waste of money . page 364 : Principles of Long term investing : `` Chapter 8 shows that among the S P 500 Index returns , value stocks have a edge over growth stocks .

However , upon opening the book my thought was , `` these all look like school yearbook photos '' , which is exacltly what they are . It seems that that 's primarily what type of photography the author does and his book is geared almost exclusively to that market . His concern , which he stresses throughout the book , is creating a `` picture '' , and he keeps emphasizing the importance of pleasing mom , since she 's usually the one with say over the pictures . A title for this book would have been , `` How To Take School Senior Pictures '' . Even then , of the pictures are not very , both in their execution and in their print quality for this book . In addition , the poses are and looking , and the book is filled with typos and errors . To be , the author does suggest some basics of things to do and things not to do when posing a subject , but there is really very information here . So , if you 're in learning how to take pictures that look like a Sears portrait , this may be the book for you . However , if you really want to learn some techniques for posing your subjects in a more or more manner , I 'd steer of this book\", \"Gary - Lost Christianities Ehrman 's work is not for a person of faith . It does not take faith into consideration . It is a research project based on documents - and falsified ; and none which can be validated . I read it as an follow-up to his work `` Lost Scriptures '' - Books that did not make it into the New Testament . I was warned by my minister who is also a scholar and has two Ph.D. 's - and my minister was . In Lost Christianities , Ehrman seems to make an effort to discredit our books of the New Testament by implying that New Testament books may be , forged , translated incorrectly , altered to serve a purpose , etc ... Ehrman clearly attempts to form a relationship between the New Testament books to those falsified books that did not get into the New Testament . Ehrman 's Lost Christianities starts out , but ends to the point of losing and disinteresting the reader . If for nothing else , it is an attempt to test your faith , but in the end your faith will be strenghtened - if you have faith . The book leads one to believe that the author is as a critic as he claims to be a scholar . He does present all sides of the New Testament story and it is interesting how the New Testament was formed . However , the lack of confirmed and documents will lead one to begin to question if Ehrman is or merely much like the media does . To save you the time and money , simply let your answer any questions you may have on the validity of the New Testament and how came to be . Ehrman and critics ( ie. , The DeVinci Code ) seem to be profiting by creating questions about the truth and validity of the New Testament story . Save your money and give it to your church instead .

The dialogue is , the plot uncompelling and Carr relies on the use of exclamation points to inject some excitement ! ! ! into this tale , which left me skipping pages at a time as it neared its conclusion because I could n't bear to read the sentences .

The Hongs wanted desperately for their family to be entwined with the Moon family , and after arranging for one child to be wed to the Moon daughter , they pushed Nansook to marry a Moon son .

This book has a lot of words which feel and can make anyone 's conscience ease in thinking that `` your will is god 's will . '' ( quoted from Walsh 's books ) If you will it , then God wills it because he loves you and wants you to live in freedom , right ? Will is a precursor to action . If there is no this an a ' or 'wrong ' will , then in essence there is really no thing as a 'right ' or 'wrong ' action . If someone else 's actions hurt you , you feel that action is . But the person who hurt you certainly had his feelings for acting that way , right ? It was his will , therefore he was and and god 's right there to back him up . The victim is suffering . Where is his god when he needs him ? Was the victim correct in believing the action ? Was the perpetrator correct in believing his action was right ? In this book , god says that WE have the authority to decide what is or . The action is both and , right ? . This is when you may want to take a look at the Bible . The portrays God as a loving yet HOLY God . Holy is defined as or of devotion as one perfect in goodness and righteousness . He loves us but sees a REAL AND DISTINCT right and as as day where sometimes it appears to be a mass to our senses . He created us and gave us a conscience which can in cases discern a right and in a situation . He gave us a will which allows us to then choose that right or . Are we always going to do the thing ? No , and He knows that . When we do thing , it is at to believe that doing is the thing to do because we desire it . We 're NOT God . We do wrong all the time and God simply wants us to acknowledge this . He wants us to exercise our FREEWILL to do right according to our conscience and what 's told in His book . But he knows that even still we will do when attempting in faith to do right . And that is why in a act of sacrificing Love He sent His Son Jesus Christ to SHOW us the way , sacrifice Himself on the cross for our wrongs , and be there still today to forgive our wrongs when we believe in Him and in the truly thing He did for us . It 's a thing ! I urge you to believe that the Holy Bible is not a lie and Jesus Christ simply did the things the book said He did and is the person He claimed to be . 11 disciples took everything they said and wrote to their grave and never recanted even after persecution . Wow ! I 've been a believer in Christ for almost seven years and He 's continued to worked wonders in my life . I would have been a fan of these books if God had not put me on His path .

'' My year daughter was diagnosed with autism at age 2 and we took a approach , including things like supplements , a GFCF diet , and OT/PT/speech . After a year on the GFCF diet and supplements and no change in behaviors , we went back to a diet with vitamin supplements and continued her therapies . Our friends ' daughter , now age 4 and also diagnosed with autism , took a approach , but even , following the DAN protocol as well as the recommendations of this book , including chelation , a array of supplements , GFCF diet , OT/PT/Speech , ABA , etc . While our child has made advances , or friends ' child has not , beyond advances related to her age -- at 4 , she is still , far from trained , exhibits behaviors , and needs verbal and cues for the tasks . The point I am trying to make is that every child is and no one , NO ONE has shown that one course of therapy cures or even convincingly improves a percentage of children with autism . Autism , as of you likely know well , is a term . Our friends ' daughter no doubt has a very kind of pathology than ours . I have yet to really see a book or study address that fact first and foremost before offering a course of action , rather than immediately launching into predictions of one `` cure '' for a range of issues . While I do think some of what the author recommends can be ( and it really may offer a help for some children with autism ) , some of the therapies ( like chelation ) can be very -- in fact , I have yet to see one of the families who tried chelation therapy see improvement in their child 's symptoms . I have seen success with GFCF diets ( for a percentage of children ) , but the success seems to come with therapy . I certainly understand where families are coming from -- I have been there myself , but treating your child like a guinea pig and attempting to `` cure '' them with substances that have had very study/peer review in a frenzy of worry is both to their bodies and to their emotions .

'' Instead I have focused on `` Of Mice and Men '' and his lesser known works , as `` To a God Unknown '' and , my favorite , `` Pastures of Heaven . '' I 've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in . When I began reading `` In Dubious Battle , '' it appeared the most of all Steinbeck 's work . Telling the story of American Communist party workers Jim and Mac , it begins with the story of Jim initiating himself into Mac 's cell . There is a ( and misleading ) sense of intrigue - Mac and Jim travel by boxcar , work secretly through letters , go from contact to contact and finally among orchard workers . Early on , the pace is fast , exciting , and engaging . Suddenly , Steinbeck simply fails to deliver , leaving the reader wondering when he 's going to pick up the pace again . After Jim and Mac slowly initiate a worker 's strike , I expected the sense of excitement to continue . It simply never does . Summary of `` In Battle '' - Workers get . Workers get tired . Workers get . Workers get tired . Workers get . Workers get tired . The rest of the book mostly concerns Jim and Mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking . And while their chats are mildly interesting at , they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book . of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration , and of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over nonsense ... ... and eating . Steinbeck must have been while writing this story , because at a 25 % of the story concerns finding , eating , and ( of all ) TALKING about food . There is plenty of action that Steinbeck could have shown during the story , but for some reason he prefers to focus on Jim and Mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment , discussing whatever comes to mind . Steinbeck 's sense of intrigue and injustice is reading the chapters . But I advise any reader of `` In Battle '' to take this course - after the strike is initiated , simply set the book down . You wo n't miss anything . Nothing of import happens , and only a very characters ever surface , and they are lost among the sea of faces . I suppose now I 'll give `` Grapes of Wrath '' a go .

For example , the author uses the three pages after the introduction to describe Aztec sacrifice in literally detail before proceeding on to the use of cocao beans as commodity money . I think that 's meant to be what they used to call in show business a `` grabber , '' but for the reader expecting to learn about money , it 's a distraction . Another problem is that the author 's grasp of economics is at , and especially in the part of the book , he 'll make a point and then repeat himself , much as an trying to extend the length of a term paper that 's run a pages short . And yet , there 's also some and oddly tidbits of information here . The author states that L.

I 've read three King books that have had the passages with depictions of horror , doom , and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story . This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really and . And this is exactly what `` Insomnia '' is . This is n't a spoiler , just the author 's note : at the end of the book we read 10 , Nov 10 , three years in which King took to write this book . Three years which were evidently wasted . The King books I 've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification . `` Insomnia 's '' Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with . He is , kind , has gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and . His counterpart Lois Chasse does n't come across as . Instead she serves as a character who has no flair or identity than being in love with Ralph . King does n't usually do that with his characters . characters with roles in this book come across as and , like Ed and Helen Deepenau , the three bald doctors , and Ralph 's confidantes . Then there 's the abortion mess . This issue crumbles midway and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story . Though King does provide an and seemingly commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker ( albeit with a tranparently slant ) , it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no than a story device . I gave the book two stars because I am an writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are to utilize as part of a writer 's arsenal . The devices were and all thru the reading I asked myself , 'How is King going to get through this ? ' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert 's narration ( via third person ) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance . It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story , he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him . This is a tool for a beginning writer , but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning . One thing , the villians just do n't work . They are not frightening , they are not , they are not or malign . Three doctors with scalpels and scissors ? Their defining characteristics are being and does that really frighten anyone ? The villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his madness .

His cynicism drips from almost every sentence and his contempt for all things Objectivism is to anyone who takes ideas seriously . I can not recommend this book even to those in contrasting views of her approach to philosophy ; this book was written for those of mind to the author ... whatever mind they can be said to have . The body and scope of work done by Objectivist scholars who 've never met Ayn Rand now ellipses her work - both fiction and non-fiction - and the work of her core of thinkers . To characterize the movement as a cult may have had some validity in the years prior to her death , but only in the most sense of the word . Right now the ranks of Objectivism are swelling with people who differ in background AND in opinion . Mr. Walker 's principle mistake is looking at Objectivism as something that was born exclusively from the mind of Ayn Rand ... something Miss Rand herself would disagree with . Objectivism is the continuation of a line of thought that views mankind as a reasoning animal ... a line that extends back through history and begins ( explicitly ) with Aristotle . Those ( like Mr. Walker ) who dismiss it on the basis of Miss Rand 's personality and the culture of people that grew around her in her lifetime are truly missing an opportunity to enlighten themselves . There is no doubt Ayn Rand is a figure ; my advice to those inclined to read Mr. Walker 's book is to read Miss Rand 's books as well . Particularly her non-fiction .

This was not the time I checked the book out of the library but I now know much about antidepressants and the issues than I did when I first became with Kramer 's book . What I found on my survey of the book this time amazed me . This is not a book supported by research . It is a book of stories . The stories , one after the , are about Kramer 's patients ( Kramer is a psychiatrist ) and how Prozac dramatically transformed lives overnight . Consider these four examples . 1 . Sam : `` Sam not only recovered from his depression , he declared himself than well . He felt , more vitally , less . Now he could complete projects in one draft , whereas before he sketched and sketched again . His memory was more , his concentration keener . His memory was more , his concentration keener . Every aspect of his work went smoothly . He appeared more , more , less . He was to speak at gatherings without notes . ( Page x . ) 2 . Sally : After four months on Prozac , she looked brighter , calmer , , in control of herself . The most effect of the medication , Sally felt was that it cleared her head ... After months ... she negotiated a promotion and pay raise at a time when the bank was cutting back staff ... More was the change to her life . She started going to dances ... ( Page 147 . ) 3 . William M : The patient 's self-esteem , which had been since his childhood , began to disappear ... On medication William M. experienced a sense of to any he had felt before . ( 203 . ) 4 . Ms. B : For the time in her memory she felt perfectly relaxed and sitting at home reading books or listening to music and felt of the anxiety that was previously quelled by going out ... Off Prozac , Ms. B. bar-hopped in search of men . Prozac moderated her sense of aloneness and allowed her to enjoy a variety of settings . Dozens of examples could be cited . The point is , this is essentially the book . It is a book which convinces the reader of the almost power of Prozac by sharing stories like these . What is disturbing is that I now know the truth . Research investigations have found that the power of antidepressants has increased dramatically . They are now more because our belief in the power of a pill to cure shyness , anxiety , depression , and a temper has increased dramatically . We have come to believe , as Kramer puts it , `` biology is '' ( page xiv ) . No where does Kramer explain that the of the trial used to get approval of Prozac to market was only 8 weeks long . No where does he share that a tranquilizer was given to study subjects and the tricks used to make the effectiveness of the drug appear than it really is . The dangers of use ( diabetes , Parkinson 's disease , muscle jerking , etc . ) are never discussed . ( Of course , these problems were still when Kramer wrote . ) See Timothy Scott 's wonderful , and unlike Kramer 's book , carefully documented book America Fooled : The Truth About Antidepressants , Antipsychotics , and How We 've Been Fooled to find the dangers as well as what does bring health . Yes , this book has been . Thus , Kramer bears some of the responsibilty for the myth surrounding antidepressants .

For those not already with the authors ' theory , Strauss and Howe are two authors who began writing about generations in 1991 . They wrote the book Generations , which introduced a theory that generations fall into four types , and each type comes of age during a kind of era , or `` '' . The Generation is of the `` '' type , for instance , , , and in tune with their emotions , and came of age during the Golden Age of postwar America . The Baby Boomers , remembered for their `` Awakening '' in the 1960s , are of the `` idealist '' type , concerned with God and spirituality and impassioned about what they believe in , but inclined to change during life ( from hippie to the `` Just say no '' control freak ) . Generation X , which they named the Thirteenth Generation , is of the `` '' type , being alienated , and , without a feeling of need to be `` '' to anything , coming of age during the 1980s and 1990s . They then first identified everyone born since 1982 as the `` Generation '' , and predicted back in 1991 that it would be grow up to be , and , just like the G.I . Generation that World War II , going back to the `` civic '' type generation before the Generation . In 1993 they published the book Thirteenth Gen , which specialized in Generation X and why they are the way they are . In their book , The Fourth Turning , they went back to the theory and writing about all the generations . They also changed the names from , idealist , and to Artist , Prophet , Nomad and Hero . Strauss and Howe wrote in this book about an era of battle and mass destruction , much like the one in which the G.I . Generation came of age . They then predicted the Generation would form the role of Heroes during the coming crisis , and they would lower pregnancy rates , stop using drugs , serve the United States , in even , and desist with using profanity . So then in 2000 they put out this book , Millennials Rising . In this one the authors try to explain the Millennial Generation ( my generation ) . Millennials Rising attempts to identify who we , the most ethnically generation in history as they note , are . In Millennials Rising they write about this generation 's Boomer parents and their influence on the Millennial Generation , as well as the kind of world in which this generation is growing up ( which S H think of as hundreds of television channels , SUV lifestyles , rappers who swear , and people who smack each on TV ) . The book states that Millennials want to work together in teams , believe the people in authority know about right and than they do , are about learning and going to school , are loved and protected by their parents , achieve things in school and will achieve things in the future , and we forget , always want to exude that `` peer pressure '' on their Millennials . The obviously leads to the question , then , is the generation really , and just as they say ? Consider this : Only 28 % of school seniors say that the work they get assigned at school is `` '' , only 21 % describe their courses as `` '' and still barely over a , 39 % , believe that what they do in school will have any relation to their success later in life . The generation was supposed to be about learning . The Generation also rapidly increased drug use , especially , from the level at which Generation X was using them in its teens , as even the authors themselves note . S H portray the world of entertainment , as television shows , movies and music , as a battle . In music , for instance , artists are described by extremes that either represent the alleged Millennial values or go actively against them -- on one side , artists like Eminem , Limp Bizkit and Marilyn Manson , on the , bands and Britney Spears and her imitators , along with bands as the S Club 7 . They do not deal with the interest in bands that lie somewhere in between the two . For instance , Blink-182 is just about the band around now , and yet Millennials Rising does not mention Blink-182 and the fans who make the band a success . South Park : Bigger , Longer , Uncut is the authors ' idea of where culture is today . Millennials Rising heralds bands as what music will increasingly be like as the decade unfolds , and blasts the `` '' bands as groups that will be washed away , but could the authors have predicted bands like Good Charlotte or artists like Avril Lavigne ? This leads to the question of whether the book and the theory will be to predict anything . S H write about `` rebelling by being '' during the decade . Apparently , their idea of rebellion is not listening to Limp Bizkit , blasting censorship , or doing drugs , but wearing clothes , waiting until marriage to have sex , and trusting their government . According to them , we should expect to see Millennials petitioning for policies that will punish their peers . S H write that we will accept the draft and join the in numbers when the crisis presents us with a war , and even do National Service . Frankly , can anyone imagine any than 20 % of today 's school students doing their duty and risking their life in war in the name of America ? Also , our generation has done nothing to make a commitment to following Bush as leader during the Iraq War , while S H predict Millennials serving their president . How to a Hero generation is that ? The G.I . Generation followed FDR so blindly they had to print his campaign materials in Braille . When it comes to rallying around their president and leading the direction of the nation during a crisis , Millennials have surely disappointed those who expected them to do just as the authors said we would . This , of course , does not have to be a thing , but it does make you wonder about the limitations of the abilities of the theory . Some parts of it make for very reading , but all the talk about how they are to be the `` '' generation gets to you sometimes . S H seem to believe you can never think too about those Millennials . Millennials Rising presents an image of youth that is set to amaze you and will attract readers , but sometimes what the book describes just is n't happening\", \"Get the picture elsewhere It certainly is no surprise with the development of technology and expansion of capitalism that workers are the future in Society .

It introduces the stage metaphor into sociology ; all of interaction is a performance on a stage . It 's how novel this metaphor is , but this is certianly its statement . The language used to present the ideas of the author is , like writing , unecessarily complicated . There are some problems with clarity and structure ; the book just doesnt have a feel for me . No background is presupposed , there is quoting from sources , footnotes , and ways to enter literature throught the book . So if you are in reading sociology , this is probably a place to start ( again , the language is thick and this may be it 's bane as an introduction ) . However , the book is misguided . The idea of viewing interaction as a performance on a stage is . The authors motives for saying this will make my position clearer . ( The following is a charicature of the author 's argument ) . There is certianly a amount of behavior which is directed towards people ( the audience ) in order for the audience to build an impression of the actor . Well , if it can happen here we can draw a with situations , infact all situations and therfore all of interaction is like a performance on a stage , `` All the world is not , of course , a stage , but the ways in which it isnt are to specify '' ( p 72 ) . The performances can either be with individuals , or groups of people , and they can be performing conciously or unconciously . ( end of charicature ) There are arguments , obviously , and the statement `` we can draw a with situations '' is of the content of the book , which i dont like to gloss over with a sentence . But the question here is , is the view worthwhile ? My answer : No . Social interaction is a phenomena that cant possibly be summed up with a signle metaphor . Yes , some interaction is like a performance , where indivudals are intentionally making impressions on one another . Yes , some behavior can arise from beliefs . However , interaction is exactly the way we see it , conciously controlled , , interaction with individuals ; it is not some kind of performance with the purpose of creating a `` reality '' . I hope my view of the book is so that the biases on the part of my review can be sorted out : the book is a waste of time . Where the author is , the statement is little than sense . Where the author goes outside of sense , he 's , sometimes plainly so . This book is part of the tradition in sociology of thinking that society pulls the wool over each individuals eyes , that reality is a construct with no purpose than control ( here the wool is the performance , and the control has to do with impressions ... but this quickly degenerates into an mess of assertions ) . There is no support given for of the claims . Where `` evidence '' is given , the evididence is so heavily intepreted that it fails to correspond to facts in the world but rather to facts about the views of the reporter . Where there is no correspondence to the world there is no truth . sources of sociology are cited , but this is more like bullying . Saying that some author , which also didnt have any support for his claims , agrees with you is just to bully your reader into acepting your claims . The claims in the book have no application in the world , but only serve to intepret situations differently , and in opinion , less correctly . Nothing said here will lead to predictions about behavior or a understanding of psychology . In , this isnt a study at all . My qualm with the book deserves its paragraph , the use of language . The example is the definitions given at the end of the introduction `` A performance may be defined as all of the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of the participants '' ( 15 ) . This is a definition . Me breathing while work is a performance , it changes the percentages of O2 and CO2 in the atmosphere near my co-workers . Me staring into space is a performance , people see me stare into space and are therefore . Infact , me simply existing is a performance , since my existance causes a effect on the participants , as well as influencing them to create beliefs about me existing . Its as if Goffman created a definition for performance which included all actions taken by any person , and then wrote a book about how all actions taken by any person fall under the category of performance . He didnt . He used a word that we associate with behavior ( performance ) and defined it in a way no one is used to . Then he used alot of word play to show that behavior has no substance , its all for the purpose of maintaining reality . I hope this very example shows the use of language that is to Goffman and sociology more generally . So an ode to sociology is in order ... actually no it isnt . Why wont this subject go away ? This book is an part of sociology , and it espouses the methods and style of researchers and writers by being an work within the tradition . The methods are ; the style is . Like it or hate it , sociology is a part of thought .

I loved I am Legend and seeing the list of books this guy has written which had been developed into horror movies ( Hell House included ) I was really to read this . I have heard complaints about the book from calling it `` porn '' to `` sick porn '' and then even being offended by the sacrilege present in the tale . Sacrilege in a book called ... Hell House is probably something you need to come to terms with before picking it up . Attacking the author because of the content is really something that is not . I doubt these were Mathis ' `` fantasies '' in the book but more his idea of melding something together with something terrifying . It is an way to convey horror to a reader . to enacting violence on children , or , babies in cinema ( try watching the Hills Have Eyes without being on the edge of your seat while the villains in the movie dangle the fate of an infant in your face ) . Mathis should not be condemned for content . Here is what he did right . He took the idea of a haunted house and brought it into the world of science . like I am Legend used science to define its vampires , Hell House uses science to define hauntings and it is very well researched and within the framework of the story . The parts may be more . His characterization is . There are four characters really and their personalities do not define them . You will remember Barrett by his limp , Fishcer by his fear , Florence by her beliefs , and Edith ... well because there is no one else . They are paper and have no motivations . The pacing seems too . A lot of moments are left on revelations in the point of view characters mind which that character has not fully processed because the chapter ends before they can relay it and all of its profound meaning to you , the reader . As a matter of fact the revelations themselves , when all is said and done , are really pretty . There is also a habit characters have , when going into lengths of exposition that goes on for pages , to cup their hands around a coffee cup . It seems too like a commercial for me ! Anyway , the book hardly slows down for characterization or details and we get very descriptions in the book . Sometimes I wanted to know what things looked like , I wanted imagery not just exposition for pages . What was it about the atmosphere that , say Fischer found so ? We needed the scenes to be developed . By the end I was so of lines like : '' God do you know what this means ? '' `` What ? '' `` I ca n't tell you now but it 's ' !

The fear should come through our attachment to the characters not the mystery of the house because the mystery of the house is kind of . This book is not it , unfortunately .

The writing style was far below Stephen King 's style and it was very , which I suspected Tabitha King to be the author . However , the accounts of Ellen were obviously written by a man , as the episodes were definitely not from the viewpoint of a woman . So , it was no surprise when the author was neither Stephen nor Tabitha , but a author I have never heard of . The book reveals almost nothing about Rose Red and it 's secrets .

The Prologue begins with a photo of POWs at the end of WWI . The photo caption states that the Army at the end of WWI was `` '' and implies that Germany capitulated because of a loss of will on the part of its leadership . This is doubly misleading . The Army was soundly defeated on Front in 1918 and then began to disintegrate . In 1918 , Germany was essentially a dictatorship run by Ludendorff and Hindenberg . The leaders who lost will were the High Command . Defeat on the battlefield and despair on the part of commanders hardly meets the description of an army . Keegan is essentially repeating the `` stab in the back '' myth used by the and wing propagandists to undermine the Weimar republic . Its astonishing to see this published decades later by someone who is supposed to be an expert on matters . This type of error recurs throughout this book . My relatively error is Keegan moving the Ploesti oilfields , a resource , from Romania to Hungary . See reader reviews for documentation of a number of errors of varying magnitude . Just as and in some cases even more are Keegan 's failures to discuss aspects of WWII . He makes effort , for example , to discuss the origins of the war . Indeed , his paragraphs on this topic suggest that he finds it too confusing to discuss . Leaving aside his shirking of his obligation to discuss this topic , there are overviews of 20s and 30s that are guides to this admittedly topic . Instead of an effort to discuss the origins of the war , we get a and somewhat discussion of how industrialization transformed technology and organization . Instead of a discussion of the history of the Weimar Republic , for understanding the ascent of the Nazis , we get another discussion of the Freikorps phenomenon . Among omissions are his failure to grapple with the significance of the Allied bombing campaign against Germany , a issue analyzed insightfully by Richard Overy in 2 of his books . Keegan 's discussion of the Holocaust in both and implicitly misleading . Partly because he does n't discuss the origins of the war and the role played by Nazi ideology in starting the war he fails to show that in respects the Holocaust was the point of aggression . The Nazis went to war not just to overturn the Versailles settlement or even to conquer Eastern Europe , but to impose their notions of conflict on the rest of Europe . Without this background , its to understand the outbreak and the nature of WWII . Among things , Nazi racism prevented them from rationally exploiting the resources of the Soviet Union , a factor in their defeat .

To be to Keegan , writing a concise 1 volume book like this is very . The 1 volume work on WWII is Gerhard Weinberg 's book , which is about 1000 pages of text in a fairly font .

Everyone recognizes that far books are being written and published than can be read . Why are people so to be authors in a market ? One reason , apparently embraced by the Goldstones , is that it is so to write a book ! All you have to do is write down some reminiscences of your experiences . They do n't have to be particularly experiences . You do n't have to do any research into your subject . If you describe what all the people you encounter are wearing , if you go into details of how you found a babysitter for each trip you took , if you quote phone calls from relatives and shop keepers ( even if they are not or ) , and if you describe the hotel rooms you stayed in , you can finish the book in a couple of weekends ! And readers can finish the book in a couple of hours with harm done . The book does accurately represent the travails of beginning book collectors , and I recognized some of my experiences in the stories the authors tell . However , the book does not take the effort to educate readers so that they can skip over errors , nor does it attempt to answer of the questions that the authors themselves raised when they first began collecting . What determines the price of books ? Why are editions ? Why should Tarzan books cost than works of literature ? These are questions that anyone might think of when getting into book collecting , and you will find the questions but not the answers here . The book is written in a breezy style that is to get through , and if you have two hours at an airport to kill , you could do than to read it . But by the time you arrive at your destination , you will have likely forgotten of what you just read , because so of it is details of the authors ' lives , transportation problems , and experiences . If you are really in book collecting , it would be to read one of the books that describe what one should look for , how prices are determined , styles of book collecting , and so on . Fragments of this knowledge are transmitted in this book , but they will leave you with questions than answers . To be , not every book about book collecting needs to be a font of wisdom .

Choose `` Watership Down '' or Fans of the ABC-TV show `` LOST '' will probably be buying `` Our Friend '' in droves after having seen Desmond keeping it to be the `` book [ I ] ever [ ] '' . Since I did not have to buy it , having purchased a set of Dickens years ago , I immediately set out to read it . What a disappointment it was ! Dickens wrote it on an basis publishing it in a magazine over a 19 month period . One can not avoid a suspicion while reading it that it is , just a bit , perhaps , 'padded ' . Any editor could have tightened it up at 200 pages . Dickens ' work is , but some of it is just than is with art . As Oscar Wilde said of 'The Old Curiosity Shop ' , `` I simply can not read of the death of Little Nell without laughing . '' 'OMF ' goes quickly down to this level of bathos and remains there to the sentence . Even is the ending . Some endings just ca n't help but feel contrived ; and Dickens , having gotten a number of his characters into positions , pulls so colored rabbits out of his hat that the reader simply cheated . All of this may seem rather harsh from someone who was to shell out hundreds of dollars for `` The Complete Oxford Illustrated Dickens '' but I assure you that my concern is for you , reader . Unless you are possessed of time to read the whole of Dickens ' oeuvre or are required to read `` Our Friend '' , I would , instead , you to Dickens ' far works : 'David Copperfield ' , 'Oliver Twist ' , 'Pickwick Papers ' . If you are looking for 'LOST ' reading material , I would refer you to 'Watership Down ' ( Excellent ) , 'The Stand ' ( by Stephen King , entertainment , not literature ) , 'The Dark Tower ' series ( by Stephen King , entertainment , not literature , and to 'Our Mutual Friend ' possessed of a fatally flawed ending ) or a review of philosophy like 'Locke , Rousseau and Hume ' .

What a bunch of baloney . First of all , evolution , in the sense of `` descent , '' is not . Even ID-iot superstars Michael Behe , Stephen Meyer , and Jonathan Wells have admitted as . ( See a summary of their testimony in the Kansas biology curriculum hearings in the evolution/creationism forum at the West Virginia Gazette . ( wvgazettemail ) ( put `` /forums '' after com ) So any ID-iot who thinks all that bafflegab about complexity ( IC ) and the nonsense in this film is the death knell of evolution is simply . Man evolved from ancestors . Get over it . Thaxton in ought to read that summary , since he himself was one of the witnesses and looked particularly . In any case , the data discussed in this book is indeed nothing but bafflegab . Talking about the allegedly foundation for design makes it sound deliciously , especially to poorly educated ID-iots , who generally are about science ; but even if the data is , it 's nothing but a facade , because it has nothing to do with the book 's conclusion . For example , imagine your neighbor told you that his dog could play Beethoven concertos on the piano . Skeptical , you ask for proof . `` , '' your neighbor replies . `` See , here 's my dog , and there 's my piano . '' Only a moron would accept that as `` proof , '' and yet ID-iot Christians are more than to accept exactly that kind of `` proof '' from films like this . The problem with your neighbor 's `` proof '' is that it proves only the existence of the dog and the existence of the piano . Neither of those issues , however , was the cause of your skepticism , so the `` proof '' was entirely . The issue , of course , was not the existence of the dog and the piano , but rather the ability of the dog to play the piano , and your neighbor 's `` proof '' was completely on that issue . Again , only a moron would accept evidence of existence as proof of ability . In this book , there 's a lot of talk about how systems are . That is nothing but meaningless bafflegab , because the existence of systems is not a issue . The issue is how those systems came into being , and on that issue the book 's `` evidence '' is completely . This book was designed to fool poorly educated , easily ID-iots . Judging from the reviews , it seems to have succeeded . Well , there 's a sucker born every minute , and apparently a lot of them are found in churches and seminaries . In one of the very evolution debates , Thomas Huxley accused Bishop Wilberforce of using his and gifts to mislead and bamboozle people . Things have n't changed much since then . Instead of evidence , this book substitutes a argument . `` Gee , look how it is . It must have been created by an designer . Maybe , just maybe , it was God . Wink , wink . '' arguments are . Only suckers are taken in by them .

I was getting very and frustrated after the half of the book - as readers have highlighted , Julia 's inability to stand up to Richard made it for me to like her anymore .

She opens it to find Janice Kepler , mother of Lorna Kepler standing before her with the tale of her daughter 's death . Not only this , but she also explains to Kinsey about how no one ever solved the murder because Lorna 's body was left to decompose for months in her cabin house . They talk for a while about the circumstances surrounding her daughter 's death until Janice tells Kinsey about a video that was sent to her house after Lorna 's death . This tape leads Kinsey on a chase of suspects in the light district and gets her nowhere when it comes to turning over the murderer . Millhone dives even further and searches through the world of Lorna 's day job where she uncovers a lead about an , elaborate project which is angering people a amount . Kinsey also checks up on Lorna 's family members , and with the exception of Janice , all seem to have a motive to murder her Lorna .

Unfortunately , I was sadly . I get the impression the author intended to write a book , but was only to come up with 40 pages of material ( located at the end of the book ) . Facing an irate publisher , he then filled in the 290 pages with his Economics lecture notes . As a result , readers who have taken an economics course will find of the material repetitive , while those who have not will most find the material too confusing to be of any use . ( Despite the glowing accolades on the cover , the author 's explanations are no than those in a textbook . ) The author also posits questions for the reader to ruminate upon , but does not provide any answers . Aside from textbooks where questions are intended to be assigned to students , tactics are . Of course , the author may be priming the pump for sales of a `` Hidden Order Supplement '' . A point is the author 's tone , which is frequently condescending towards the reader ( . telling the reader they would not understand the math behind a given theory , so it will not even be presented ) . While this may be for a layperson reading the book , being talked down to certainly does nothing to build their confidence or cultivate their interest in the matter . Overall , if you can borrow a copy from a friend or a , the 40 pages are reading . Otherwise , save your time and money . Reviewer 's background : B.Sc .

Some of the descriptions for the attractions go through them , including plot points in 3D movies and so on . The book also leaves a lot out in areas , as dining ( coverage ) , getting around Walt Disney World , and hotels and dining . For me , the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World ( by Bob Sehlinger ) was at giving me the info I needed without giving away any details as to the surprises on the rides . That is , it told me what might frighten a youngster , what might bore an adult , and so on , but it did n't say specifically what would happen at every stage of any of the attractions . Just generalizations about the ride , then warnings for types of people . The things Birnbaum offers that the Unofficial Guide does n't are pictures and info on some of the activities as parasailing . If you have an Internet connection , you do n't need the pictures . And as for the activities as well as maps , you ca n't beat the Passporter book on Disney World . So , for me , the Unofficial Guide plus the Passporter yields the trip planning library for Walt Disney World . If you like , you can also pick up the EZ-Guide , as it also has some maps and info . As for Birnbaum 's , it really does n't have anything to offer . I would n't recommend against buying it , though , except for the `` let me tell you the plot and ending to the movie before you go '' mentality . I hate spoilers , and wish someone had warned me before I started reading this book\", \"Interesting Thesis , but overlooking some points Mr. Friedman 's book begins with an thesis , defining morality and its definition within a context of growth . The idea that growth or stagnation effects the mindsets of the people living in that time period is a argument that Friedman often well supports with facts . However , the exceptions to his argument make me wonder if he really believes in his thesis , or if he just felt the need to write a book . Furthermore , for every chapter in the book , there seem to be at one or arguments or points that , with a thought or research , do n't make sense or can easily be disproven . With these things being the case , I find Friedman 's argument a to buy . The book seems to build up to the chapter , which Friedman uses to make policy recommendations that would aid in growth ; this chapter could have stood alone from the book entirely , however , because the evidence in the book an his arguments elsewhere in the book ( . the importance of education ) do not add or support his policy recommendations . His policy recommendations could have easily been listed by students in an class as responses to the question `` What should the government do to promote growth ? '' They do n't push the argument forward or indicate anything that has n't already been suggested in the past , nor do they give suggestions as to how to go about implementing his policies .\", \"Hardcore Jargon on Intersectional Group For decades , studies scholars have left issues facing non-heterosexuals to the side . For years , `` queer '' scholars have left concerns of people of color to the side . This anthology tries to address that void . It goes a way in proving that , academics can be just a and hardcore as gay ones or ones . The anthology has numbers of men and women . In some ways , it 's a Who 's Who of Black Gay Academia , including works from Cathy Cohen , Dwight McBride , and Jewelle Gomez . Still , there is about this book that frustrated me . A years ago , a study was done of LGBTs and respondents said they hated the term `` queer , '' yet the academics here champion it . Really , if `` queer '' is supposed to represent the four groups equally , then this book was quite lacking in its coverage of bisexuals and the transgendered . This is given writers as Alice Walker , Stuart Hall , and June Jordan . Often `` people of color '' is used when only blacks are brought up ; Latinos , Asians , and Native Americans barely come up in this book at all . James Baldwin is brought up often here . I understand that . His writings were and often dealt with and issues simultaneously . Still , I kept thinking about how hooks once wrote that Toni Morrison gets a lot of attention when publishers wo n't print the works of women that are equally as . James Baldwin deserves his crown in , letters , but I 'm about him being the only one to get to wear a crown . books have been printed about the members of the Harlem Renaissance , yet that group hardly comes up here . James is getting a bit played out and the authors here are not helping change that tendency . Finally , I had beef with of the essays . Charles Nero has points but his essay is really two works glued together . Can anyone really say the whiteness of New Orleans ' `` gay ghetto '' is to `` Chasing Amy '' or `` Feet Under '' ? One author could have written quickly about how he supported a gay , student when that student was condemned by a masculine , one . Instead , he went on and on in jargon and . Kara Keeling 's essay was 90 % theory and 10 % a discussion of Dunye 's `` Watermelon Woman . '' Why bother to bring up the film if you 're barely going to discuss it ? I was n't really feelin ' this text , but that 's not to say it did n't have aims\", \"The get it In a review remarkable for saying nothing about the book , Popop from Boston ( April 9 below ) alludes to some children blown up by an IRA bomb in a North of England shopping center . Popop is very . It pains him that anyone would bad-mouth `` armed operations '' . They were perfectly justified , he explains , because of thousands of Catholics murdered at the hands of the army . I know why thousands of murders are to Popop . Without them , while he might justify bombings in his mind , he could hardly do so in company . But I live in Ireland , not America , where news of these murdered thousands has not reached us . Gerry Adams never said a word about them , not wishing to be laughed out of the country . He had to make the all these years of a dozen fellows caught in a crossfire in Derry in 1973 . I guess he saved the one for the boyos in Boston . What of all those dollars that Popop broad-mindedly dropped in the Semtex collection box ? They were not wasted . Thousands of Irish really were murdered - mostly not Catholics but all of them really - at the hands of the disorganization that Mr Adams always denied being a member of . To be , his non-henchmen failed to terrorize the Northern Irish into caving in , but his enforcer , who can barely write his name , did get to be Minister of Education ( I 'm not making this up ; I could n't ) . Oh , and the book is quite . There 's a lot about Bushes , Arabs and the kind of tax-cuts that went over my head . There 's wit of a subtlety rarely seen since Voltaire - you can tell by the CAPITALS and ! ! ! ! . There are explanations of 9/11 to suit every taste , whichever Bush you blame .

This is a book about what a Tom Master of the Universe does on holiday . It 's nearly to have an `` adventure '' when you are carrying 10 ( ! ) platinum credit cards . He got and wet a times , worried about finding gas , did n't always have hotel rooms up to his standards , and had delays at some borders , yawn . The adventure must have been resisting the urge to buy an airline ticket back to New York using one of his Visa cards . I rode a bicycle around the world for 19 months at about the time Mr. Rogers was having his `` adventure . '' I am stunned that he perceived so in his travels . I do n't know how someone could travel in countries that extensively and end up completely by the experience . However , this fits perfectly with his arrogance , which is truly the theme of the book . He already knows it all and will tell you all about it . Which makes one wonder : why did he bother to leave NY City in the place ? I guess it was a opportunity to pose with and boink the and ( and ? -- certainly ) daughter of one of his clients . And a opportunity to pump himself up by feeling to all those `` faces '' he 's driving through . The arrogance , the arrogance ! privileged , know-it-all . I 'd like to see him try to survive in the highlands without all his money and equipment . This is not a travel book : Mr. Rogers uses his trip as a way to sell a rant . You can save yourself a lot of time by just reading his chapter , `` Afterword . '' I will summarize his position : governments are ; , guys like me are ( remember October 1929 ? ) . of his predictions are laughably . He advocated selling the US economy in 1993 . Look at the US stock market performance from 1993 through 2000 ... Gosh ! Idiot ! Some reviews are touting his prescience on markets . Hello ? How about his predictions on the economy in the world ? Mr. Rogers ' writing is very and it 's loaded with cliche 's . He and Tabitha are always zooming on `` steeds '' into `` scenery '' , or `` , mountains '' into `` glitzy , hotspots '' or `` , hostels '' , or across `` , , deserts '' into `` dumps '' that are not up to standards . He 'll `` describe '' one of the mountain chains on earth , the Andes , as `` the top of the world '' ( p. 315 ) for five sentences and then move on to more matters like adventures with border guards and investing . Great writing ? ! I think he used a computer program to come up with his `` descriptions '' of the places he went . Mr. Rogers is woefully about the places he goes - and he does n't learn anything along the way . He views the world exclusively through the keyhole of economics . of the `` facts '' he mentions about theses places are just . One example : He describes the Moreno Glacier in Argentina as , `` one of the in the world still moving . '' ( p. 294 ) I found myself laughing out loud times at his `` facts '' and descriptions . If you want to understand the distribution of goods in the world , read `` Guns , Germs , and Steel , '' by Jared Diamond . If you want to read about a motorcycle trip , read Ted Simon 's `` Jupiter 's Travels , '' or Robert Fulton 's , `` Caravan .

While even the Hendrix fan knows Jimi was born in King County Hospital , ( Now Harbor View ) Lawrence states he was born at the home of a family friend . ( ) Jimi is quoted allegedly throughout the book but from some tapes of interviews that no one has seen or heard and that Lawrence conveniently plans on destroying so one can profit from cigarette packs ( yes , cigarette packs ) and necklaces are being sold via ebay or to collectors allegedly having belonged to Hendrix , siting Ms. Lawrence as the owner and source of authenticity . At one point she aledgedly quotes Hendrix as saying : '' The LSD passed around San Francisco was a discovery for me , I 'd taken acid in London but ... . '' Aside from Jimi 's use of the word 'fabulous ' being at , the fact that Hendrix had already tried LSD in New York in 1996 before going to England and subsequently Monterey is knowledge among and again makes all of these alledged direct quotes . Those of you who have listened to and read the hundreds of hours of interviews through collectors , releases and press clippings will also find some of the wording of these alledged quotes that the book , and the credibility of it 's author are based on , extremely . At one point Ms. Lawrence even offers an quote from Hendrix 's mother who passed away in 1958 : '' Jimi baby '' she told her son `` I have to escape this '' While quotes like this can illicit an response from the reader , they are clearly . Throughout the book people close to Jimi are referenced but very sparsely quoted , if at all . I shared the recount of Jimi 's trip to Berkeley as a child ( Pg.5 ) with Jimi 's aunt Delores and she laughed openly and wondered aloud where people come up with these stories . This from a woman who was actually there and involved in planning said trip . While making a reference to Ernestine Benson and misstakenly referring to her husband Cornel as `` Bill '' , Lawrence again allegedly quotes Hendrix in lieu of an interview with the Benson 's who are both still living and have hand insights having lived with the Hendrix 's . Lawrence 's assertion that Hendrix committed suicide simply because his journal was left out is no less than Jimi 's adopted stepsister Janie 's claim that Jimi did n't OD . Lawrence then stops just of gleefully giving herself credit for Monika 's suicide , but the jist is . This book is than a bit with Lawrence lauding herself as much as she does her . While proclaiming herself to be a confident of Hendrix ' the consensus is that she was n't around that much , if people even know who she is at all . For a much well researched and look into Jimi 's life read Electric Gypsy or even more so , the book Room Full Of Mirrors by Charles Cross . The Man , The Magic , The Truth , while very , is with glaring inaccuracies and is for the part a novel about the author and her subject , not a biography or a record .

I have been reading a series of accounts of day warriors and had hopes for this title . As others have pointed out , Coughlin 's ego can be suffocating at times . This could be forgiven if it were the books only flaw . Alas it is not . The writing is at and the author 's overuse of and hyperbole is very distracting . The language is disjointed and as if it were written with the use of a thesaurus . Again this could be forgiven as we 're reading this book for a soldier 's account , not that of an grad student . This book offers a contrast in comparison with Nathaniel Fick 's `` One Bullet Away . '' Whereas Fick seems to be an intelligent , and warrior whose concern is the welfare of his men , Coughlin conveys himself as a intellect with more concern for glory and satisfaction than anything else . He is a team player when he hand picks the team and considers them of his company . You can not know a person from reading their writing but Coughlin 's character development is very . His attempts to convey a `` side '' are and seem grossly contrived . This is a contrast to the character development in `` One Bullet . '' There is no connection between author and reader in `` Shooter . '' Coughlin does not develop the role players either . In `` One Bullet '' you really feel the brotherhood developed among the officer , his NCOs and the enlisted men . Additionally , Coughlin 's descriptions of his support staff ( pullers ) is and reinforces doubts about his team ethic . To make matters the action is n't as well developed as in titles . The author 's tone and emphasis on exploits , with plenty of after-action chest thumping , obscures the view of battle . He spends time on the finer elements of sniper tradecraft , training and shooting . This can be found elsewhere . Overall this book was a disappointment . If only a fraction of Coughlin 's exploits are , then he is a sniper .

Rossi , therefore is being fairly depicted as publishing information within paradigms . On the math side , Rossi mentions Fibonacci 's algorithm and phi , two paradigms that clearly were not used in Egypt , though like to suggest that they were . The Fibonacci algorithm idea was introduced after 1891 and J.J. Sylvester 's views of the RMP 's 2/nth table , are point to 1202 AD and the Liber Abaci , but not a reference point of Egypt . Egypt used more ideas like http : //egyptianmath.blogspot.com and http : //akhmimwoodentablet.blogspot.com . Yet , Hultsch in 1895 clearly showed that Ahmes in 1650 BC easily wrote out 2/p series into and unit fraction series using a very partitioning method ( as Ahmes wrote out answers in his position ' algebra problems , ie . 5/19 written out in a awkward series using 1/12th as the partition , as he did for 2/19 , as describe a couple paragraphs below . Ahmes wrote 5/19 per , 5/19 - 1/12 = ( 60 - 19 ) / ( 12*19 ) = ( 38 + 2 1 ) / ( 12*19 ) or , 5/19 = 1/6 + 1/12 + 1/114 + 1/228 ) . scholars ( two being ) have often suggested that supposition ' was used by Ahmes , hinting that Ahmes guessed at his answers . Ahmes never guessed ! Ahmes' answers were always when he worked with numbers . Moderm scholars were the ones that had guessed , and missed , finding Ahmes methods . Interestingly no scholar , until very recently , has claimed to have read Ahmes ' shorthand notes . Modern scholars had sadly filled gaps left by Ahmes with their guesses - of which have been proven to be ( as Rossi had not learned , since he referenced none of the fraction and weights and measures issues ) . Bruins also discovered the Hultsch method in 1945 , and today the method is named the Hultsch-Bruin method . It says that 2/p = 1/A + ( 2A -p ) /Ap where A , a highly number selected in the range p/2 lt ; A lt ; p with the divisors of A uniquely added to ( 2A -p ) thereby solving ( ) /Ap . Example , 2/19 = 1/12 + ( 24 -19 ) / ( 12*19 ) = 1/12 + ( 3 + 2 ) / ( 12*19 ) = 1/12 1/76 1/114 with the ( 4 + 1 ) alternative being discarded since its denominator was too . Rossi also mentions that division may have followed an operation of its multiplication 'doubling ' method . Here also Rossi did not seen the remainder found in RMP # 62 where 100/13 = 7 + 9/13 = 7 + 2/3 1/39 . Generally Ahmes and all scribes divided by this Q = quotient and R = remainder method . The Akhmim Wooden Tablet even shows a method for grain and volume division where a hekat unity 64/64 was divided by n , with lt ; 64 , as ( 64/64 ) /n = Q/64 + R/ ( n*64 ) Even more , Ahmes also used this method to divide 100 hekat by 70 , with his form matching the Akhmim Wooden tablet 's use of ro = 1/320th of a hekat , by : ( 6400/64 ) /70 = 91/64 + 30/ ( 70*64 ) and introducing ro = 1/320 of a hekat , = ( 1 +16 + 8+ 2 1 ) /64 = ( 150/70 ) * 1/320 1+ 1/4 1/8 1/32+ 1/64 + ( 2 + 1/7 ) *ro I 'll not go on and discuss Rossi ' view of architecture being the above her Cambridge comments . Overall , accept Rossi 's view as , and I do as well , in areas . However , on the side of Rossi 's use of a Sylvester 's and techniques , all disproven years ago , shows that her Cambridge training needs to be expanded to read the texts . Clearly Ahmes and his brother/sister scribes are the experts that should guide our understanding of math .\", \"Wade I give this book a rating because of the misinformation that Nicholas Wade has presented and in the manner it was presented , `` DNA and the Secret Family of Thomas Jefferson . '' This most `` '' statement leads the reader to believe that he `` seems '' to know so about genetics and man that he knows all about the Jefferson-Hemings DNA Study and for what `` reason '' he sees to include it into a book as being very suspect as mentioned by some reviewers . He seems to not associate science and truth together as it pertains to the Jefferson-Hemings controversy . Unless I overlooked it , I saw no reference to the work that Spencer Wells is performing for National Geographic Socity . I assisted this study by providing access to Jefferson DNA sources . The result of a match was found in the Phoenicians , ( Caanites mentioned in the bible ) and in lands that today are Syria and Lebanon . From what I know of the study ( I assisted Dr. E.A . Foster with the DNA study ) , Mr. Wade 's analysis of this is extremely , in fact , it is extremely biased . `` Thomas Jefferson fathered an family with his slave mistress Sally Hemings '' ( pg 257 ) . What fact does he have to give this statement ? He makes the most of giving details by lying James Callender and lying Samuel Wetmore/Madison Hemings in Pike Co. , Ohio . Why the details in a book topic as this ? I will give you readers on the DNA topic my opinion . As you may see in my reviews of books , these authors know nothing of the details of the DNA Study but spread biased media tales . He did not inform you that a team of ribbon scholars ( 13 professors ) for the Scholars Commission ( [ ... ] ) and determined that there is no proof that Jefferson is of these charges . You may read on my page : www.angelfire.com/va/TJTruth all the details of this study . He can not plead ignorance of the details because I sent him my research early in the media blitz and any reporter not using the search engines to thoroughly search a subject is most in my opinion . Can any researcher read his book and believe he/she is receaving knowledge . My knowledge of the topics he has written about is , BUT I do know this Jefferson-Hemings Study and he has done no or research . He references Annette Gordon-Reed as some type of `` authority '' on the controversy . She was charged by the Scholars Commission Report as having completely rearranged a letter from Jefferson 's grand-daughter to give a meaning to her words . To add insult to his otherwise attempt to influence your thinking , Wade has a figure with the title , `` Thomas Jefferson Family with Sally Hemings. ( Pg.260-261 ) . '' His lack of knowledge of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson is lacking in research because he goes into details that Martha Jefferson and Sally Hemings are half-sisters ( an rumor brought forward by people wishing to confuse readers and to be politically . He does not mention a very book by Dr. and Mrs. James McMurry , `` Anatomy of a Scandal , Thomas Jefferson and the Sally Story '' , who did research on this rumor and found it a lie designed to fit earlier mud slinging . Since he did not give the reader another source for study , another VERY book , `` Jefferson Vindicated , Falacies , Omissions , and Contradictions in the Hemings Genealogical Search '' , I will tell you it has a foreword by Monticello Director , James A , Bear , Jr. All of the named books , including , `` The Jefferson-Hemings Myth '' are through Amazon . I do agree with Wade 's sentence on the Jefferson-Hemings controversy ... ... . '' Some mysteries lie beyond the power of even DNA to resolve .

His contribution is represented by his ability to enter the psyche of the book 's characters and divine their , but , motives and thoughts . Quite a feat for any !

In the antebellum period , this building and its resident slaves were , interestingly enough , owned by a who was financially ruined in 1863 by the Emancipation Proclamation . As an amateur historian , I would have thought that a book about the New Orleans slave market would contain some facts about these markets . What were their addresses ? What percentage of their customers were ? What percentage were ? How slaves did the New Orleans household have ? How were they fed and clothed ? What were their working hours ? These are questions that should have been addressed but instead , the reader is given an emotionally charged , , rehash of , previously published material . In , this book , for the part , reads like a rambling , overly long .

Sadly Ben Alba 's `` Inventing Night : Steve Allen and the Original `` Tonight Show '' , is not that book . It is , largely , a poorly edited and pastiche of previously published memoirs by Allen himself combined with some interviews with Allen 's TV contemporaries . These interviews could form the basis of an book by the likes of biographers Scott Berg ( Sam Goldwin ) or Neal Gabler ( Walter Winchle ) . The opening chapter , which addresses Allen 's , education and his days in radio and TV sets the stage for the author 's failure to create a , portrait of Allen and his work . Alba draws here , almost exclusively and certainly uncritically , from Allen 's memiors while combining these words with one quote from a childhood friend and two reviews . Taking Allen and the reader 's one witness at face value , Allen had a rootless , violent and childhood . Given these conditions Alba gives no hint of how , why or even if , Allen really remained attached to his drunken and generally mother and her equally extended family . The author gives us two stories from Allen 's adulthood to demonstarte that the family ties endured . Actually , all the stories show is that Allen attended an uncle 's and very briefly troted his mother out once on his Sunday night show . How did this world of Allen 's youth effect his two marriages and five sons ? Why , after a childhood on the fringes of a show business existance did Allen choose this career field for himself ? Alba does n't even pose questions about the boy 's effects on the man . He just plows ahead in a haze . Throughout `` Inventing ... '' Alba maintains this pattern of unquestioning acceptance Allen 's words . No witnesses are called , no points of view are examined . Steve tells a story ; Alba accepts it and edits it into his text . Why not read Allen straight ?\", \"A Review As Ugly As This Novel It truly is the war fiction regarding WWII if you have never read ANY fiction regarding WWII . I love war fiction and non-fiction and beside parroting the Time Magazine blurb prominently displayed in the novel I can not even come close to understanding why anyone , let alone review after review , would even come close to that stupefying conclusion . To me it is the example of snobbery that critics like to pat themselves on the back with . Only they understand and you intellects are not of appreciating . What it is , is a , , waste of time . Of course any piece of literature is , but to me , this critically work fails on every level that a novel should , regardless of genre . Unless you love James Joyce ( another writer lorded over us by the critically ) , I think readers expect some sort of plot development . Do n't expect that here . How about engaging characters that develop and grow throughout the novel ? You pick up something else . It seems to me the reader should at be invested in one of the character 's outcome . Far too a thought if you `` get '' this art . If I ca n't have any of that how about writing a character that is even remotely ? Forget it leaguer ! I was rooting for the Japanese to kill them all , so at their `` loved '' ones at home would be spared of these nearly universally beings . The thing that propelled me to finish was to get to the ending that would perhaps tie together the experience of reading these soldier 's ruminations while , oh by the way , a war was being fought around them . Nope , no ending either . It just ends . Yes , I have heard that the plodding ugliness and pointlessness of the book is to symbolize war itself . Give me a break . While this may be news for us folk duped into reading it , it certainly is news for Tom Clancy .

Somebody is going to have to explain to me the difference between what Risen has done here , and what the Walkers were imprisoned for . Imagine a WWII era reporter , during the war , giving away that the Allies had broken the Kreigsmarine Enigma code in order to challenge how money was spent doing it ; or how we used signals to test intentions in the run-up to Midway just to question whether we correctly evaluated the information ; or disclosed the landing beaches in a vain attempt to substitute their `` expert '' opinion . James Risen 's product is the thing , only with a vibe . And when hindsight is your insight , you know you 're in trouble . It 's to figure out who had it right on intelligence issues a years down the line , even to find the `` heroes '' eager to tell their tales of victimization . And that 's really all State of War does . It collects a pile of disconnected ( often and ) anecdotes , and fleshes them out . The more the story , the it 's sourced , and the fuller its fleshed .

Well in my opinion , there is no longer any doubt that some things appear to be flying in our skies , and some people have had some experiences ( mostly disturbing , but some apparrently enlightening ) , but the question is , is it all as it seems ? The fact of the matter is , branches from around the globe have hardware that could easily fool us . projections can and are used to place images within our skys ( this is related to theories surrounding the 911 events ) ; there are devices that can manipulate brain waves and excitation to have people hallucinate any scenario ; , drug manipulated techniques can control memories and behaviour ; implants have been around for decades and have even gone mainstream now ( Verichip ) . I 'm not saying that lifeforms do n't exist in the Universe ( far from it ) , and perhaps there are a number of entities here on Earth carrying out agendas , but this idea that there are , menacing Greys abducting us for sinister reasons without COLLUSION seems . It smells of fear mongering that the love to push on us .

The fact is that with technology ( not including whatever they may have that has not been leaked ) , they could quite easily pull the hoax off .

Why no discussion or mention of the , or NAZI connection with abductions ? There seems to be a growing number of victims who are recalling `` fragments '' of memories that are slipping through memory covers . Why are they mentioning cooperation of doctors and nurses with the Greys ? Why are they mentioning swastikas and known insignias on uniforms ? Why are some speaking English , others ? Why is there a connection with , bases and specifically Antartica ? These are things Strieber never mentions , which I find .

There are far , far communications engineers out there than John R. Barry [ infinitely better to be ] . And what makes these others better others meaning engineers ; John R. Barry being a `` engineer '' ] is not ability , memorized knowledge , or even shrewdness , but rather the difference lies in a faith of facts ; something a follower of Proakis never seems to possess or even grasp the possibility . In fact , the values and beliefs in the Proakis text seem to promulgate not only Abuse , but also a sort as well . In a nation ( where Steven Pinker , who like Proakis is of Harvard Fame , has noted ) that has around 75 % of its population esentially believing in the account of things , this kind of abuse can be very indeed and lead to consequences . Though it may not be , nevertheless , the values and beliefs of Proakis 's text and those of its instructors tend to be extremely spiritually . These values and these beliefs somehow set up a cognative dissonance with student 's values and beliefs . The result is almost always a broken-spirit . From an perspective , this is . Very .

What happened ? How did he come to cobble together this breathtakingly smorgasborg ? Where did the imperialist conspiracy come from ? Johnson , where did you go ? Well , the answer is that he delves into areas of which he has no knowledge . His take on America 's policies is . Anyone who questions why the U.S. Army is still in Korea after 50+ years need only point to Seoul on a map and drag his finger a couple of inches north , where he will discover NORTH KOREA .

Reality This book is inexplicably , probably to its catchy but ultimately title . Barber fails to convincingly analyze an thesis , instead delivering an exasperating 300 list of every thing on Earth that he disagrees with . Barber contends that behavior results in and enclaves trying to separate themselves from the world , while capitalism is erasing flavor with mass-culture sameness . Interestingly , Barber contends that these two movements are actually in an alliance , using each 's excesses as excuses for their behavior . That is a thesis , which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating . The part of the book is an tirade of lists within lists , of trends that Barber disdains , in an avalanche of complaints that is not but merely and . It 's all tied together with attempts at `` '' pop culture references , terminology ( like the annoying `` telesector '' ) , and quotations and namedropping . All is lumped together unconvincingly under the term `` McWorld , '' which is so and as to become meaningless . In his examples of how trends are damaging the freedom and intelligence of the masses , Barber merely comes across as a condescending snob who thinks his interests are , or a curmudgeon who thinks everything was back in the days , or both . In the part of the book , Barber proceeds to throw obtuse science theories at world hotspots , in which tribalism and separatism are damaging the integrity of nation-states . His term for this phenomenon is the dangerously term `` Jihad . '' Note that this book was published back in 1995 , so that word was not as prevalent in discourse as it is now , but Barber still uses the term as a descriptor which is to offend both devout Muslims and anti-Islamists . When it comes to the specifics , reviews here and elsewhere list out the flaws in Barber 's arguments , and there are so of them that a lot of reviews are for the task . You can agree or disagree with critiques of Barber 's contentions based on your politics . But everyone will probably conclude that in this book 's section he does not deliver on the implications of his initially thesis ( embodied in the book 's title ) , and simply forwards borrowed theories on society and the sector . , this book is mostly the grumblings of a know-it-all who portentously predicts doom for every and reality of the world . ~doomsdayer520~\", \"Do n't fail to read this if you 're to Earth In today 's world , forms of parochialism have a relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism . These forms of parochialism may be , `` , '' , , etc. , depending on where you look . On one hand , ancient forms of identity continue to define and out-groups ; on the hand , corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace . Example : the Turks and the Armenians hate each and even partly define themselves by this conflict ( `` Jihad '' is Barber 's label for this ) ; yet they see the Pepsi ads and do the kinds of work in their Pepsi bottling plants ( `` McWorld '' is Barber 's label for this ) .

But , Steve Berry , sorry . And for all you people out there who do n't like it when people give reviews of a book you like , just hang on a before you give me a fat NO vote .

And , btw , this is a place , so some editor somewhere should have noticed this . Shame on you , S.B . 's editors . OK , I 'm not saying a novel must contain no anachronisms whatsoever ( it IS fiction , after all ) , but really , glaring mistakes of geography or history can not be tolerated . The issue I have with this book is the attack on Jesus Christ and the resurrection and the Bible as a whole . Cotton Malone , our hero , says that the Bible contains hundreds ( I 'm paraphrasing ) glaring inconsistencies . If I remember correctly , he says that one of the gospels ( he picks on Matthew a lot ) does n't place Bethlehem as the place of Jesus ' birth . That one does n't hold water -- I checked Matthew myself . Says so in ch . 2 . I do n't mean to thump the Bible , but who is Steve Berry to question the authenticity of the world 's # 1 bestseller ever ? That 's quite ... some would even say -- but I tread on glass . I really ca n't go into the character development , or lack thereof , or the Knights Templar . Yeah , they 're and , but Malone seems to bump them off with the of ease . Some `` Knights of Christ '' they are . Well , having alienated of you , I bid you farewell as I go in search of a more book\", \"Meh Jesus , talk about the girl crying `` wolf . '' When I picked up this book , I expected to read a truly tale about how people got with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with . What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of presumption . The book starts out promisingly , even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose . We 're given the account of Charles Monet , one of the cases of the Ebola virus . From there on , Preston gives a description of the virus , what it does , how it does it - the works . Then , he moves on to the Human Component , the cast of characters , so to speak , for the story . The story is , alas , not so . It 's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause problems to come about , but nothing of the sort happens . Basically , people run around in gear , fret a lot , and monkeys die . In between , Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about cases of the Ebola virus , cases of people being infected , `` crashing and bleeding out , '' cases that are a lot more than a shipment of monkeys , unless you 're a PETA type . The thing about The Hot Zone is just how Preston is . He starts to novelize his subjects a chapters into the book , which is a idea , but not when they do n't die at the end . Basically , he 's trying to make you care about these people , and all for naught . And by the time that you 're supposed to be truly , you actually WANT them to die , because you 're tired of hearing about him describe , in detail , what they eat in the morning , what they do in the afternoon , and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night . When you 're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus , why are you time talking about Nancy Jaax 's hands and karate prowess ? Moreover , when you 've finally gotten to the monkeys , why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the ? Does anyone really care ? I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways than to reverse my peristalsis , but I ca n't . Preston 's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are and ; he had the chance to write a thriller about an crisis of proportions , but he instead chose to `` get into the minds '' of his subjects . And what a bore that became . There were only two redeeming aspects of this book : one was the description of the African , Ebola victims , and the was the description of the virus itself , although , again , both were sabotaged by Preston 's inability to write . If you want to know something about Ebola , go get An Idiot 's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics . If you 're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element , read The Hot Zone .

Baxter leads the reader around the world from his beginnings in Australia , thence to Britain to the US and ending in France . Again , there is no context . He would flip from a reference to the artist , to an anecdote about himself or some bookseller or collector and then perhaps mention how he had acquired a book .

The reviewers who have lamented the , paragraphs that irritatingly jump from one scene to another , without benefit of explanation or connection , are to scorn the writing that makes up this book . I had to read some times and even then did n't understand what I was reading . It was nearly to picture of the action in my mind , as it was mostly just a collection of facts and anecdotes that rambled on and on and on . The description of the fire itself drags on chaotically for pages , which incited one yawn after another . The book lacks any sense of focus and the author uses a very choice of words in instances . For example , the is littered with sentences like : `` She made for the exit ... '' Okay , , but did she run , walk , crawl , hop , skip , jump , or fly to the exit ? I just do n't know what to picture there . The word `` made '' says nothing descriptive and is about the word that could have been chosen . This type of problem occurs on every page of the book .

However , he warns , a diet of junk food can be . advice concerning pop even more to this book . Yes , it contains a kernel of truth , but it ultimately is if not balanced by a diet of thinkers and theologians as Thomas Merton , St. Francis of Assisi , Ron Sider , Tony Campolo , Brian McLaren , Brother Lawrence , Philip Yancey , Wendell Berry-the list goes on . It often is of oversimplifying the conflicts the Church faces , drawing the lines down to `` Christians '' against the `` naturalists '' or `` humanists , '' thus ignoring the range of threats that seek to destroy the Church . While there is truth in Colson 's writing , I believe it ultimately stems from a flawed worldview-one defined largely by thought and nationalism , sprinkled with the politically amount of belief . His faith seems to be overly , one that favors rhetoric and proof over prayer and disciplines . Evangelism , it seems to Colson , is comprised heavily of apologetics . The secularists must be shown that they are , he says . Yes , there is truth and there is time for debate , but this book seems to prefer winning debates over building bridges and relationships . You see , I used to fear evolutionists and the round table of `` humanists '' that evangelicals love to discuss . But as I 've grown , I realize that threats to the Church come more often from within than from culture , and they almost always have to do with power and politics than the Enlightenment or science .\", \"I AM I DID PAY FOR THIS BOOK !

Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel , which is , but he ends up putting the message above the story . Grisham devotes much of this novel to a plaintiffs ' lawyer and his law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits . This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain , in agonizing detail , how tort lawyers sue companies and collect fees . Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the wealth of class action lawyers , and how they put their greed above the interests of their clients . In the end , none of this adds up to an storyline . It does n't help that the lawyer in this novel is a rather person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall . Since I did n't care for this character , I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely . This novel is also rather and in tone .

She opens it and then sort of wakes up and she thought it was a dream . She now has a name , Chaya . She now has to figure out what happened , and what she will do in this body .

Gould presents fabricated objections to research and selectively studies that make a correlation between intelligence and brain and size as well as differences in brain size between the population groups and correlations between brain size and class . Gould only ridicules the most claims of racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven . For anyone who has no knowledge of biology , this book will give them a very view of the science .

I 'm not whether the book is a memoir , a novel or a treatise . In `` Zen '' Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son , Chris in the 1970s . But the story , I guess , is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology .

This book is , extremely and a waste of time . The reason I finished it was because I paid for it . I truly believe that Danielle Steel has lost her gift of writing . She has not published a book in a time . I also think that she 's lost her editor , because to me , a editor would n't let books like this be printed . This story pretty follows stories she 's done before except it 's told from the guy 's point of view . There 's the guy , Charlie , who ca n't seem to find the `` '' girl to marry . He finds a flaw with every one he dates . He lost his parents at a age , his sister left school to raise him , and just before he graduated college , she died of a brain tumor . So of course he 's that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him . Then there 's Adam , whose wife left him and took their two children with her . It was a divorce , so he has no desire to ever marry again . He dates girls half his age and never stays with one long . His parents blame him for the divorce . Every time he visits them , his mother let 's him know what a disappointment he is to the family . The of the trio is Gary , a struggling artist . He has no desire to ever marry or date . The three men spend the month of August each year on Charlie 's yacht , partying and going on and on about how they do n't want commitments . Well of course , each one meets someone , they start to date , they argue , they break up , they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after . Same story .

This is the Nevada Barr that I have read . I picked it up on the strength of Deep South , which I thought was really . It was frustrating that nearly all of what I liked about Deep South was missing from Flashback . Flashback is structured with narratives which involve both the murder and a war mystery related to Anna Pigeon 's family . The war story ( told through letters and sequences ) is clearly intended to add a note of mystery to the story . Some may like the flavor that this element provides , but for me it dilutes the elements of the writing that I most enjoy . I really liked the realism of Deep South , and felt that the style put it a cut above books in the genre . Flashback , on the hand , felt painfully contrived . The plot line with the letters was extremely and ( to my mind ) . If you like mysteries with a flavor than you like realism in a novel , then you will probably be significantly less than I was by Flashback . Barr at made a choice with her approach to the book . Judging from the reviews , not everyone had a reaction to the interwoven plot lines . I will go ahead and pick up a Barr book , because I did like Deep South so much .

So , there were than just five million Christians . There are now approximately only a thousand Christians in Modern Turkey . The question that the author pointedly neglects to address is what happened to the difference between over five million in the 1900s and only a thousand people today . We know that over a million surviving Greeks were expelled in the exhange of populations between Greece and Turkey in 1923 . Again , what happened to the difference of million people ? To the 1.5 million Armenians , must be added three quarters to a million Assyriac Christians ( Arab Christians ) and as as two million Greeks ( almost 30 percent of the people ) . The author does not touch on the numbers of Christians who were enslaved by Turks or forced to convert to Islam to avoid massacre which explains the number Greek-speaking `` Turks '' around Trebizon on the Black Sea . It is not as if there is not accounts of and observers of this genocide and cleansing of the , populations of Anatolia . I can only conclude that the author had such an bias in favor of Turkey as to ignore a slaugher that approaches the holocaust of WWII . Avoiding this amounts to holocaust denial . The genocide was the genocide of the century and Hitler 's model for the genocide . The massacre of the Greek and population of Smyrna ( now Izmir ) ranks with the Rape of Nanking in sheer horror and scale , but the author skips over it in a rush to avoid any detail of the crime or assign any blame except to the Greeks and Armenians by repeating the discredited canard that they set fire to their city . The author 's treatment of the Christian genocide reminds me of the comments to me of a officer at a NATO conference which were to the effect that there had been no genocide ( the Government official line ) but , in any case , that they had deserved it . The author seems to have taken her treatment of the subject from the Government as well\", \"BAH ! Correction Please '' Karl Marx , years ago , gave a description of why this might be happening . He followed the most and theory for wealth and value : an object is as as the effort it takes to make . '' NO IT 'S NOT ! ! ! An object 's worth is based upon both the supply of an object and the demand for it arrising from consumers . To imply that it comes from the effort it takes to make implies that a milkshake that takes only a minutes to make is far than a vial of poison that took an hour to make or an bomb that took months to make , which would mean that we should subsidize the complex , since all those workers worked to create those things . `` Petty-bourgeois ' owners , i.e . the stores and business in , of which my grandpa , a dentist , was a part of , are being driven under by chain competition in retail . '' This is either to the innefficiency in their store to meet consumer demands or to the regulations burdened upon them by the government . All regulations do nothing but add an increased burden on to competition and thus kills them out . There 's a reason why the owner 's of Wal-Mart recently said that the government should increase the wage to over $ 8 , as this would cause businesses to go , lay off employees , and future businesses from starting up to compete with Wal-Mart . Another problem is the subsidies that the store pays to Wal-Mart ( Wal-Mart collects millions in subsidies to Marx 's Labor Theory of Value once again ) and of the use of emminent domain abuse ( which can be justified on the grounds of the `` '' as opposed to the good of your mom and pop stores ) . `` But no theory is ever , and socialists should be to correct their flaws to account for nature and `` reality .

'' there is . beings are inherently , differing in skills , abilities , ambition , the choices that they make in life , how they apply their time , etc . etc . Of course , there is is n't any reason that individuals ca n't create wealth nonetheless , creating goods and services that help others out in exchange for some or service itself . And cooperatives need to be . Nor can cooperatives produce the bulk of wealth . There needs to be some Division of Labor , Trade and Commerce , etc . or else all cooperatives end up as hunter-gatherering tribes reduced to the law of the jungle to survive . This ca n't happen if everything is collectively owned . `` Since workers are the producers of goods from scratch to end '' NO !

Noonan was a speechwriter Reagan administration . Sound ? Noonan does not get how citizens used to live under the rule of kings and how they felt about kings . Probably she does not care . Americans are that they never had any king . Noonan fails to provide any information how Reagan dealt with things of his presidency - AIDS , Iran-Contra , welfare , deficits , funding mujahideens , cozy relationship with Saddam . Instead she tried to portray his 8 years like a Disney feelgood fairytale - ruler , citizens ... '' happily lived ever after '' . Basically , this book contains just glorification of a person who is viewed as king by the writer . Her admiration took away her ability of criticism and desire to provide any information that readers do n't know already . This is a writing isolated from the reality of 80 's ( which is nothing in civilizations ) . Secondly , she fails to understand that Reagan was just an politician and have contributions on whatever achieved in his 8 years of presidency - including Americans .

Eddie is no Willy Loman , though , and the play suffers immediately from a lack of a , driving force like Willy . Parts of the play seem borrowed from Tennessee Williams , and they do n't seem to work in this context . There is some business about the romance of the Old World Italy versus the New World of Opportunity on the docks of New York , and it is the topic that is at all explored well , if still unsatisfactorily . Eddie 's dreams are represented in his niece , Catherine ; and unlike Willy Loman 's uncle , she is still an dream . That makes Eddie 's life seem all the more , in comparison to Willy 's : he longs wearily not after what he could have had , but after what he can never have , as he is already married . The death scene at the end of the play also seems like a forced , tacked on ending , and Alfieri 's presence is a more or less stage gimmick .

The reviews were so that I decided against buying the book and checked it out of the instead . As it turns out I made the decision . All I can say is ` thank you reviewers ' ; this book was definitely not worth the purchase price . My statement has nothing to do with the author 's writing skills , he is a writer . It has everything to do with his lack of insight . That Paul Clemens could live in a city and have such a view of it is . I read the book , waiting for Paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them . But after 241 pages he was no more than he was on page one . Blacks are caricatures whose role in life is to make Paul 's life hard . Women are characters who are barely given a voice . He finds a way to put down and everyone who is not a male in his book . If you are a male who harbors racist feelings you will enjoy this book and it will validate your feelings . If you are anyone else your reaction will no doubt range from boredom to outrage .

It was very to take seriously', \"PAIN AS GOD 'S MEGAPHONE Since God is Infinite Goodness , we must conclude that the appearance of divine cruelty is a delusion . When we are , we are too to realize that we need God . Since God knows that He is the thing that we really need , He inflicts pain upon us to wake us up to this fact . So is God 's megaphone . If some people , as the Jews , try to love God without going through Christ , it is not yet God - merely the approximation their fantasy can attain . Hence God is forced to keep screeching at them through His megaphone . But even people who try their to love the God , as Job , or C. S. Lewis for that matter , can not adore God as much as He wants to be adored , so He uses pain over and over again to `` plant the flag of truth within their souls . '' Where does this notion of an Infinitely Good God come from ? Given mankind 's existence , `` an inference from the course of events in this world to the Goodness and Wisdom of the Creator would be . '' God had to reveal Himself to mankind by Revelation ; thus it is in the likes of Abraham and Moses , who identified God as , that all peoples are blessed . Lewis informs us that God expostulated with His creatures on the basis of their conceptions - `` What iniquity have your fathers found in me , that they are gone far from me ? '' One has to wonder if Lewis has ever actually read the Bible . Can anyone really deny that if a leader of today did exactly the sorts of things that Abraham and Moses did that they would be decried by all of sane mankind as monsters ? I have never understood why , or how , I am supposed to pretend that this is not . Of course , God is than me , so if I could only see it from God 's viewpoint , I would see that the butchery of populations , including babies and animals , was actually an act of love . In MERE CHRISTIANITY Lewis condemns this line of reasoning in religions as `` nonsense . '' Undoubtedly , we get the impression of a just and loving God through the teachings of Christ , but the conviction that God is Infinite Goodness , Omniscience , and Omnipotence did not come from revelation ; it was developed by philosophers by reasoning through extrapolation -- a process that Lewis , rather inexplicably , deems . Lewis 's insistence that people have will needs to be examined . Even as he describes it , since we are born in sin , we can not use will to avoid sin , and people are blind to their sin . Hence , it logically follows that there can be no will without the ability of self-perception . The evidence suggests that incessant pain , especially when inflicted upon children , destroys this ability . children typically grow up to be abusers . In my case , I adamantly insist it was the drug , marijuana , which first gave me ability , at the age of 23 . Prior to that moment , God knows that I had no will . Free will is not a realized trait that we are born with , but a ability that requires a deal of effort to develop . In people it remains largely . Since will is on self-knowledge , the role of religion needs to be the development of ability . adherence can only hinder this . Lewis is at enough to acknowledge evolution . Unfortunately , it is hardly to reconcile the notion of evolution of man from animals with his notion that animals only by destroying each because they were corrupted by Satan before man 's appearance on Earth . Somehow , the perfectly `` Paradisal Man '' descended from animals already corrupted by Satan . Lewis can be abominably silly sometimes . Lewis is given to disjunctive , either/or , logic . Either the experience of awe is a twist in the mind with no purpose , or it is experience of the - a Revelation . I would once have scoffed at this , but a vision of Christ was the turning point of my life . The problem is that this Revelation was not at all with Mere Christianity . According to Lewis , the purpose of pain is to break our will , since it is our wills that keep us from God . I had only recently come to realize that I had not had will until my sense of self was awakened by an drug . I experienced Christ in the very moment that I was cursing Christ for demanding that I beg forgiveness for that which He was . Albeit , at the time I was an atheist , and was only cursing at what I had been taught about Christ . I experienced Christ as the core of my being , not as an entity completely from myself , and as an awakening of will , not a surrender . Lewis assures me that the feeling of being one with God , rather than a creature of God , is Satan 's deception . But I have also experienced Satan within myself . If Christ were not the core of my being , I would never have survived Satan . I know the difference . I do not acknowledge that Christianity has the authority tell me what my experience of God must be . I am a scientist by training , not given to credulity , however much like it what I have written above must sound . In my attempt to make sense of my experience of Christ and Satan battling within my mind , I have come up with the myth : It is , at , not completely to assume that consciousness is an quality of existence . This consciousness would first be in a state , probably in some way for evolution , though not by anything like design by control . There could be no distinction between and ; in fact the terms could have no meaning , until evolved to a complexity of self-awareness . As developed , so did awareness of pain and terror , and a rebellion against achieving a level of awareness of experiencing pain . The mind , as the vessel of consciousness experiences these trends and , for whatever reason , tends to personify them as God and Satan , or their equivalents . What makes the Christian God so is His refusal to accept responsibility for anything . Satan can therefore be described as `` God 's self-ignorance . '' Buddhists are apparently to put themselves into the state of inanimate matter , hence there insistence that and evil are . C. S. Lewis tells us that `` it is not God 's purpose that we should go back into that identity . '' I think I agree with him on this point . Mankind 's goal must be to attain will be becoming of what we really are . ( Peter Payne , author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA : A YOUNG MAN 'S ENCOUNTER WITH THE EVIL WITHIN HIMSELF )\", \"than ! !

Another disappointment is Koontz 's recycling of elements from novels : ( 1 ) plucky , highly disabled girl ( the protagonist in `` The Hideaway '' had almost deformities and personality ) , ( 2 ) devoted , canine companions , ( 3 ) guys driving around in pimped-out RVs , and ( 4 ) evil bioethicists . The Leilani character is patently . She conveniently has a genius IQ , but that does not make the absurdly manner in which she speaks any more . I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot . Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children , and this book is no exception . Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds ; the latter , however , does not justify his habit of making children talk like genius adults . Dean heaps the hardships on Leilani , with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker , Texas Ranger . In case you miss the anvils , you are supposed to really , really like her and fear for her safety . I do n't know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics , but he has a terribly view of the field , taking an sect of it to represent the viewpoint of the field . Further , he states times that these bioethics principles are being taught to students at universities ( who will have to pay for their involvement with bioethics ) -- as a student , I can assure you that this is patently . That Koontz could be so on a topic that directly relates to the motive is disconcerting and makes an already book even harder to swallow . The issue is Koontz 's near-deification of dogs , particularly Retrievers , which is a motif in his works . It is and unintentionally to an almost degree . His obsession with dogs and their powers borders on the ( and I like dogs ) . This novel probably features the most example of Koontz 's tendency to create overly , endings .

In his 1960 introduction to Tropic of Cancer , Karl Shapiro said , `` I call Henry Miller the living author because I think he is , '' `` . . . as a example he stands among the men of our age , '' and `` . . . he [ Orwell ] predicts that Miller will set the pace and attitude for the novelist of the future . This has not happened yet , but I agree that it must . '' Shapiro does not support any of these points in his essay , and nothing about Tropic of Cancer supports them , either . Tropic of Cancer consists of 318 pages recounting Miller 's experience as an expatriate in Paris and expounding his philosophy , often in ways that are rambling and painfully . Miller 's stories about his friends are , pointless , and catty ; like Miller , they seem to have been hacks whose belief in their abilities makes them artists and writers , as though believing is being . Miller writes , `` A year ago , six months ago , I thought I was an artist . I no longer think about it , I am '' -- which is the type of pretentiousness he mocks in virtually all of his acquaintances . When they are not creating , or talking about philosophy or creating , Miller and his circle seem to spend nearly every moment picking up women ( and disease ) . They rarely use a term as `` woman '' when there are so obscene , demeaning words with which to objectify the gender . The women that Miller and friends find are invariably portrayed as , , , , sly , , and primarily for one function , which Miller turns into a , , act . In spite of all the vice and the `` living , '' no one seems to be having fun , and some characters , notably Fillmore , find themselves nearly trapped into the life . Miller expresses contempt for the machine , the age , and money -- although he schemes to keep 2,800 francs from Fillmore 's mistress and revels in having so in his pocket . Often , Miller obsesses about food and relies on his friends to support him . When he describes his friend Kepi as `` . . . a scrounger , a sort of tick who fastens himself to the hide of even the compatriot , '' he could be talking about himself as he bitterly complains about those of his friends who are with money , accommodations , food , and wine . Miller 's logic about the world is ; he writes , `` If you want , you 've got to get in harness , get in lockstep . '' On the surface , this is , but it never seems to occur to him that , if you want , someone must cultivate , raise , and the wheat and produce the components ; someone must transform these components into bread ; and someone must deliver it to the shops and cafes . In words , if people were n't in `` step , '' Miller could choose to starve or set himself to produce bread , joining the world in harness . He makes his choice clear , then whines about it . He may despise those who support him , whether they are friends or workers , but that is perhaps because he , a misanthrope who finds fault with everyone but himself , needs the very people he denigrates ( including `` the grocer , the baker , the shoemaker , the butcher , etc. -- all clodhoppers '' ) , a reliance which he resents . He hates the machine and the machine mind , but offers no alternatives . Seemingly of feeling , Miller finds emotion amusing . When a friend says , `` A boy can break your heart . . . He 's so beautiful ! And so ! '' Miller writes , `` We had to laugh at this . It sounded . But Collins was in earnest . '' When an acquaintance to whom he owes money dies , he writes , `` At any rate , he was killed in an automobile accident shortly after my arrival , a circumstance which left me francs to the . '' Shapiro claims that Miller is a poet , but his attempts at and ramblings often make if any sense . Speaking of buildings and statues , Miller says , `` . . . they must be saturated with my anguish , '' the kind of metaphor in which he frequently indulges . He describes artists as himself as the `` ones . '' `` I am ! I say it with a mad , hallucinated grin , and I will keep on saying it though it rain crocodiles . Behind my words are all those grinning , leering , skulking skulls , some and grinning a time , some grinning as if they had lockjaw , some grinning with the grimace of a grin , the foretaste and aftermath of what is always going on . '' Whenever these attempts at philosophy appeared , rambling on for pages , I found myself yearning for a return to his stories about prostitutes , disease , friends , and hunger . Tropic of Cancer is perhaps the book I have ever read ( and I did promise myself that I would read Tropic of Capricorn ) . Shapiro says , `` There are not of these beings left in our world [ emancipated from what ? -- DLS ] , these clowns and clairvoyants , celebrants of the soul and of the and of the promise of America . '' If Miller , with his whining , his criticism , his attitude , his `` art , '' his view of people , and his obsession with excrement , is the `` '' of these souls , may I never meet the .

'' When I picked up this book , I expected to read a truly tale about how people got with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with . What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of presumption . The book starts out promisingly , even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose . We 're given the account of Charles Monet , one of the cases of the Ebola virus . From there on , Preston gives a description of the virus , what it does , how it does it - the works . Then , he moves on to the Human Component , the cast of characters , so to speak , for the story . The story is , alas , not so . It 's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause problems to come about , but nothing of the sort happens . Basically , people run around in gear , fret a lot , and monkeys die . In between , Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about cases of the Ebola virus , cases of people being infected , `` crashing and bleeding out , '' cases that are a lot more than a shipment of monkeys , unless you 're a PETA type . The thing about The Hot Zone is just how Preston is . He starts to novelize his subjects a chapters into the book , which is a idea , but not when they do n't die at the end . Basically , he 's trying to make you care about these people , and all for naught . And by the time that you 're supposed to be truly , you actually WANT them to die , because you 're tired of hearing about him describe , in detail , what they eat in the morning , what they do in the afternoon , and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night . When you 're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus , why are you time talking about Nancy Jaax 's hands and karate prowess ? Moreover , when you 've finally gotten to the monkeys , why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the ? Does anyone really care ? I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways than to reverse my peristalsis , but I ca n't . Preston 's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are and ; he had the chance to write a thriller about an crisis of proportions , but he instead chose to `` get into the minds '' of his subjects . And what a bore that became . There were only two redeeming aspects of this book : one was the description of the African , Ebola victims , and the was the description of the virus itself , although , again , both were sabotaged by Preston 's inability to write . If you want to know something about Ebola , go get An Idiot 's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics . If you 're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element , read The Hot Zone .

While the title `` The Child '' accurately describes Laurie 's upbringing , this book should n't be grouped with literature . The author , while cherishing the bond she has with her daughter , reminds me of the mother in `` Love You Forever '' who sneaks across town and climbs into her son 's room at night to spend time with him -- sweet but a bit creepy . The fact that she admits that she even went to college at the time as her daughter so she could spend time with Laurie pretty much says it all . The mother clearly has her issues that I hope she allows herself to work through and heal from now that she 's not spending 24/7 with her child . We have been unschooling each of our four children since birth -- temperments and all -- and I feel very privileged to spend so time with them as they discover how it is to decode and discover the world around them .

I remember seeing the art and hearing about the title : `` Let Freedom Ring '' with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover , patriot that he is , but also a flag . I loved it , could n't be . Well , the day of the book 's release , I took a day off work ( 've never missed a day of work before in my life ) , and rushed to get this book . It looked better than I ever imagined . With the flag on the cover and the title of `` Let Freedom Ring , '' I thought , finally , technology has caught up to our patriotism .

The very `` Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book '' was published in 1950 ( still ) , revolutionized how cookbooks were produced , and was an best-seller . The recipes were the result of thorough testing in the company 's kitchens and in homes across America . This was cooking from scratch with very reliance on convenience foods in its pages . This gradually changed as Betty and her books became more and of a shill for General Mills ' products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company 's bottom line , but to the detriment of cooking . The two cookbooks that came out in 1961 and 1969 were both loaded with recipes and tips/helps , although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience -- especially in the 1969 edition -- but this was still relatively in proportion to the majority of the recipes . If you have one of these books , treasure and keep it ; you 'll never see their likes again . The edition looks but , like the editions , the number of recipes has been drastically reduced . Gone are the variations , which are especially missed in goods . It was having recipes of cakes that were sized for two people or families and having mixing methods to choose from . Now way too recipes are of the `` dump and stir '' method instead of choosing methods that would insure the results . Also gone is the very , assuring , voice of . Yes , there are recipes covering a wider range of ingredients and styles , but they are mostly versions . It 's that the folks at Betty Crocker now seem to think that no one really cooks anymore and ca n't be bothered with preparation of dishes , which begs the question of why General Mills even bothers to publish these cookbooks anymore . The `` Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook '' is a bet for those looking for an , guide . It has a layout , the recipes and ingredients are generally of a quality , and there are recipes and variations than Betty Crocker 's had in some time . Even better , if you care at all about the quality of the food you eat and serve your family , I highly recommend the cookbooks of Cooks ' Illustrated/America 's Test Kitchen . Their , cookbook is called `` The America 's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook . '' The recipes are tested and reworked -- dozens of times , if -- to be the their staff can make them and you get directions in preparing them .

However , he does n't seem to offer honesty about why this book has been so . Either he 's guilelessly or avoidant : in either case , considering how this book has become . Is it because it offers the advice on how to navigate the most and path from singleness to marriage ? No . For the majority of singles , the approach described in this book will be too and contrived to be . couples have actually gotten together this way . The reason why this book , with its overwhelmingly readership , has sold so well comes down to one reason : there is a SHORTAGE OF SINGLE CHRISTIAN MEN , as documented in CampuslifeCollegeGuide.com ratios , and the Barna Research group website which estimates the shortfall to be in the MILLIONS . Christianity Today recently identified the gender imbalance as being the issue that `` rises to the '' for singles . Because Christians are encouraged to look at circumstances as springing from `` God 's plan '' for their lives , of the women faithfully avoid doing the math , but certainly feel the lack of attention . Unfortunately , this often gets boiled down to some kind of `` Christian guy thing '' , but it probably has to do with the complacency that accompanies the abundance of women : which is the defining masculine climate wherever there is a man shortage , whether it 's New York City , Post-war Russia or your mega-church . It 's not so much a lack of leadership , but a lack of males . And so the idea of courtship appeals to the longings of Christian women frustrated by what they perceive to be a lack of initiative taken by Christian men , who they greatly outnumber . Since reading Christian books about relationships can be as titilating as any romance novel , of these women will pour over every detail looking for the one piece of advice , the one thing they can change about themselves that will make a difference . means they stay on the self-improvement treadmill , fuelling a singleness industry with its slogan `` The Gift of Singleness '' that refuses to tell them the truth about the Christian man shortage that is the cause of their singleness ! Of course , their lack of contentment ( an innate response that tells you that things do n't add up ) is something they are told to repent , ironically by pundits who themselves will not repent of how they profit from this relationship . But as long as these women can be convinced that their discontent is caused not by unnaturally protracted singleness that 's the result of the Christian man shortage but their by failings , there 'll always be a market for books like this one . genius ! What 's , there are `` consequences '' that can go along with Harris ' model for `` courtship '' that he does n't really address : 1 ) Because all initiative taking must be based on a guy 's intention to marry the woman , it makes asking a woman to do anything a BIG DEAL to him . This can have sub-consequences : ( a ) It creates a lot of anxiety for guys in terms of their and ( getting turned down for a date is enough , but imagine having your `` marriage proposal '' crash and burn ! ) ( b ) It fosters crushes , as stakes get so with the guy investing all kinds of time and energy in figuring out that this is `` the one '' , he might not ever do it ( c ) Ironically , it can boost up the guy 's expectations in terms of a woman 's looks . Because the guy has to have everything worked out in their heads ( that yes , this is the kind of woman I want to marry ) lot of guys end up not bothering to spend time with girls who do n't LOOK like whatever their `` wife prototype '' might be . Guys who date and do n't make a deal of `` a date '' are more to ask out women they never thought of marrying and possibly end up getting married anyways ( In `` How to Get a Date Worth Keeping '' , Henry Cloud explains how couples will admit that their spouses were n't really `` their type '' when they first met ) . 2 ) It keeps people from the humbling reality check that dating provides . dating ( as practiced in countries , where a guy will ask out tons of women , get turned down by of them until he has a `` '' ) teaches you where you stand with the sex . You ask your way down your `` ladder of options '' until you find your ( likewise for women , in terms of dealing with the facts about who 's asking and who 's not ) . With courtship , a man or woman can nurse an prototype of what they want in their heads for years . The idea that it 's not to have any flames to compare them to is FALSE . You 're off being compared to their girlfriend/boyfriend ( a being with chunky thighs and all ) than with the Angelica Jolie/Brad Pitt that has filled their imaginations since adolescence ! 3 ) It reduces opportunities that promote the acquisition of skills needed in a context with the sex . It reinforces the pattern of immaturity you commonly see in Christian singles circles . 4 ) It 's to the woman to have some guy spring a marriage proposal ( which is essentially what courtship is ) on her without any notice that the guy ( who 's had a start on working out his feelings ) is romantically . women seem to need some time to progressively get used to the idea of having a date with of the guys who would realistically ask them , let alone entertain the thought of marriage . 5 ) It also heightens the significance of anything the men do when interacting with the women in their circle , who inevitably end up reading too much into their behavior and expecting too whenever any nuance of interest gets expressed by a someone they like . Kind of like , `` he 's a , sincere , Christian guy and he would n't be spending this kind of time with me if he did n't think of me as marriage material , right ? `` ... not always so . If we are to stand back and take a look at it , the courtship redux really has n't gotten off the ground : it works for too people at this time . Maybe the world has changed too , or perhaps there are issues today 's Christian singles face in the mating game that need to be dealt with : as the confusion about `` the gift of singleness '' and the shortage of men . I would recommend Debbie Maken 's Getting Serious about Getting Married : Rethinking the Gift of Singleness for an view of courtship that embraces the ordinariness and universality of marriage , instead of this oldy .\", \"More errors In addition to the errors listed by others , I see missing letters in the middle of words , quote marks that are the style ( backticks instead of quotes , done inconsistently ) , indentations ... it 's a typesetting nightmare . disappointment\", \"ruined by its ignorance of sexuality I found this book embarrassing to read - not because it 's , but because it so clearly illustrates how the Italians got their reputations as lovers . Is this the that literature can give us ? This clearly of anatomy , let alone sexuality . It 's also . Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of man and even more woman , and then spends of the book trying to knock down every character and concept . This is his method of proving the superiority of his ideal . He drips way too contempt . Everything outside of sex is , meaningless , . Attempting to derive enjoyment from the `` life '' makes one ; being paralyzed makes one ; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence 's and way makes one , or , or spiteful ; not being to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of `` woman '' or `` man '' ; and so on . Looking at art is . Everything in Paris is . Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly . Reading the book without his openly commentary on what 's `` '' with everyone except C. and M. , one might easily conclude that Constance does n't really seem now that she 's sleeping with the gamekeeper , and Hilda does seem in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing `` that kind '' of happiness as and druglike . He even seems to imply that her being so with her life is yet more proof that there 's something with her . Of course Constance is wretched , because she does not have that one thing that , in Lawrence 's view , really matters in life - not Mellors , but Mellors ' equipment . This book does degenerate into phallus-worship , which makes the author 's hostility toward `` druglike '' pleasures seem sort of ironically . Hilda is precisely because she can derive enjoyment from pleasures : from Venice , from the feel of the sun , from jazz , from dancing . This seems to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman . Hilda is also described as than - she is a `` user '' , with suggestions that she is and - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a man , only to walk away when the dance is over . ( This may be why at one reviewer called the book sexist , since obviously Lawrence does n't mind if Mellors is and behaves as a `` user '' . ) It 's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is consistently knocks pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one 's body . Everything is except sex - and not just any sex , but his notion of sex . This is where readers will have the most trouble . Lawrence clearly defines a `` '' woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with examples . A woman who lays there `` '' is clearly an example . Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc . Lawrence does n't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or is n't doing could even be related ; it 's presented quite clearly as a difference between women vs. women who are not only physically , but in character . On the hand , a woman with an urge to be In Control - that is , one who insists on moving herself , rather than sitting and letting the man do what he will - is when Michaelis is the male ( because he 's premature , and meant to be ) , but it turns when it 's women in and especially Mellor 's Bertha , who just refused to come when she should out of spite . Bertha just had a ( ! ) urge to be In Control , demonstrating her essentially and nature . The thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he `` '' her . As for all those things that women so frequently enjoy ? Forget it . Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at sometimes and , but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly , nothing . A Woman does n't need foreplay . Just hop on and go , and if she 's what she ought to be , she 'll feel crashing waves and tides sooner or later . These were what I found the most embarrassingly - that a woman 's duty is to lie there , not too , but not too , and come when she 's supposed to ( and if she does n't , it 's her fault ) ; while a man 's job is to climb on top and `` perform '' . All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly set of assumptions that are , unfortunately , not . The truth is that a woman 's vagina is not the inverse of a penis ; there 's a thing that both males and females start out with , which in a man becomes the penis , and in the woman becomes ( or remains ) a clitoris . Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the body part . Women have always known about their bodies ; surely a man so to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken time to research how women really feel about things , preferably apart from what women think men `` want to hear '' . This , too , is no doubt why it has been accused of being `` sexist '' . The author ( or at Mellors ) openly blames women who can not or will not `` come to the crisis '' when she ought , as if it were entirely of the woman 's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man . It 's also that science will eventually prove ( if it has n't already ) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be ' emotionally as well as physically . For all that Lawrence spends an lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly , even emotions and desires - as `` intimacy '' and `` connection '' , both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act , but that there is believed to be an advantage in these differences , based on the notion that a man 's job is to get his DNA out there , while reproduction for a woman involves a and commitment . If this is , it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and attitude toward sex who is the deviant , not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the sire of her child . So - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does , at the time it 's not so clearly that a woman `` should '' feel that way , as to justify Lawrence 's belittling of women whose states do n't match detachment and distance . There 's a lot of talk of `` tenderness '' - in fact , Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow `` tenderness '' - but quite I am on what exactly is supposed to be so tender . The thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her , but even there she only stands out particularly because a sex partner is so to find . I can imagine a woman putting up with - but I can not imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk , who is rude to her instead of treating her as ( remembering she 's a Lady ) when she asks him questions , who calls her c -- t as if that were her name , and generally treats her as if she were a whore . I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of , but this is how their relationship really is ; she spends far too time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he wo n't say and the questions he wo n't answer - for me to find her enjoyment in their relationship particularly . For what it 's , I think life will be better when this book has become . It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their responses - at cost to their marriages , if not their selves . Those who agree that heppiness is linked to satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects sexuality in an honest and fashion . As for those who just want a read - I 'd call it a matter of taste . Obviously some people enjoy this book .

Gray . Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray 's book , in which Gray recounts his interview with the Nat Turner , but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his racism . Unlike his depiction in Styron 's book , Nat Turner was married . Styron 's invention of Turner 's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a woman , Margaret Whitehead , is entirely . So is any that Turner did the thing by leading the revolt . In Gray 's account , Turner did not express regret . There is so much depth to Turner 's life that is either beyond recognition or left in this book . Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction ? Yes . The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are to the story he invented . Turner 's relationship with Margaret is saturated in the myth that men are obsessed with women -- lusting for the fruit , for which they must die . That Styron crawls into Nat Turner 's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause . What offends me most is that Nat Turner 's life deserves to be explored by a author who does not condescend or patronize this hero . Instead , we have William Styron 's version of Turner 's life , taken by readers as fact . If one prefers racist fiction posing as a account of a life , then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of `` Confessions . '' But if one prefers reality , I recommend Gray 's book as well as accounts about the slave revolt at Southampton , Virginia . Styron 's book does not provide insights into Nat Turner , slave revolt or slavery itself . His book clouds the truth with the kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the phenomenon of lynching\", \"This one 's a stinker I really love Amanda Quick , but this one just did n't work .

And I do n't really expect tightly mysteries in my romance novels , but the plot in this one defies belief . It 's never explained why the murder even occurs . The hero 's fear that the murderer will focus on Venetia because she 's using the name `` Jones '' is beyond . If that was going to be a plot point , at make it an name that would link the hero and heroine together . But JONES ? ! All would be forgiven if the romance were , but it was n't in the slightest .

The recipes I 've tried have been , and the instructions accompanying those recipes are fairly and , although the discussions and instructions do n't rise to the level of a cooking teaching tool , as would , for example , anything by Julia Child , Marcella Hazan , Jacques Pepin , or any of the King Arthur Flour baking cookbooks , all of which really teach one skills while providing recipes . In this case , I was already pretty experienced at making cream before I bought the book . Were I a tyro , I do n't think this book would be the introduction , although of course there is nothing like plunging in and trying . My disappointment , though , is the organization of the book : ice cream recipes are `` '' with their accompanying cookies , garnishes , and the ; instead of a group of recipes for chocolate ice cream , for example , we have a group of recipes for ice cream sandwiches , with cream of any of flavor families . One has to dig around in the index at the back of the book to find , say , recipes for chocolate ice cream . I would much prefer to have an index or table of ice cream recipes , by flavor and page number , right up front -- I do n't want to spend so time looking for the flavor I want . My disappointment is that the text is printed in a graphically and but virtually size and color . My eyes struggle desperately to read the book , even with my reading glasses on , and I surely ca n't prop the book '' back from my utensils , to read as I work without changing position , as I like to do with my cookbooks . This is a case in which the author and editorial team seemed to have chosen ( admittedly very ) style over function . The book IS very , and the photographs are lovely -- but I would gladly sacrifice some beauty in favor of being to read the recipes and discussions more easily . My disappointment is in the complexity and elaborateness of of the `` dessert packages , '' for lack of a word . Making the ice cream or sorbet and its accoutrements is , in cases , a tremendously exercise . I have opted for using some of the and ice cream recipes and figuring out my simpler and garnishes and accompaniments . I work a demanding job and have a house to run . I love to cook , but ca n't devote as time to making an ice cream sandwich , for example , as these recipes require . So I use of the book than I 'd wish . Over all , Ms. Luchetti 's sense of style and taste are , and she seems superbly about desserts . And of the ice cream recipes are lovely .

LP was the guide we purchased , based on our experiences with them , but we had the chance to peruse others in the B B 's we stayed in throughout our trip . Of all of them , I 'd rate the LP as the 2nd for our interests - as they say , experiences may vary ! Ireland has become a very $ tourist destination , so reflection , we would have been with the Rough Guide . LP has just tried to hard to cover all levels of expense in one guide , and has ended up all of them in the process . I hate to say it , but I 'd rather see them do one thing well than 3 things mediocre at . I 'd still put it above of the guidebooks though . Our and gripe is how out of date the price estimates on everything are . I realize it was published two years ago , but we gradually learned to depend on everything costing about 20 % than LP listed . That 's quite a jump for 2 years , indicating to me either fact-checking for the 2003 edition , or some pretty inflation and a need for another update . Our gripe was the maps . They failed to provide maps for a lot of the cities , and only provided maps of the areas in the ones . Given the rarity of Irish street signage , those maps would have been a God-send for navigation in towns . Also , and this may be a function of the 2003 printing , a lot of the towns in Ireland are instituting patterns in their city-centers , and LP 's maps rarely identified this . A , again gripe is with the existance , or lack thereof , of the restaurants , b b 's , shops , etc . listed in the guide . Probably 30 % of the restaurants in the guide just are n't there any . I realize they must have been when it went to print , but that did n't help us any . Our gripe is the rather coverage of areas of the country . Granted , it reflected perfectly the tourist patterns - coverage of cities and tourist areas along the coasts , pretty coverage of areas . Unfortunately , we did n't just want to go where all the tourists go , so this left our noses still further out of joint . , I 'd say if you want a guide that covers the sightes well , both LP and Rough Guide do that . If you want to keep the expenditures down , Rough Guide does it much better . If you want to go all out , , there 's probably a option , but neither of these two will do it well . If you want to be thrifty in some areas and splurge in others , then this guide is the you 'll get to filling your needs in one place - although , in that case , I 'd really recommend getting two guides , one for each end of the spectrum .

Also , of the accounts were extremely -- -couple are encouraged to fondle one another during labor to keep and .

The teaching of hell or everlasting damnation ( torment ) is a teaching that has been graphed into the teachings of Christianity over 1800 years ago . The century church never believed in a `` hell '' . The theory of hell was brought in by converts to Christianity from religions of the world . `` Hell '' was embraced by the leaders of the church because they saw the controlling and `` converting '' effect of the doctrine and thus it was adopted as `` '' centuries after the resurrection of Christ .

Let 's start with the question of Israel 's borders . Do some folks say that these borders ought to be the Nile and Euphrates rivers ? After all , Israel is kind of . Does n't it need , um , a bit more land ? Well , Israel may need a land . But almost nobody is proposing anything like this . I see very Israeli politicians demanding even all of the West Bank , let alone all of Jordan . And as for the Nile to the Euphrates , this is pretty exclusively propaganda . There 's a article by Daniel Pipes in the March , 1994 issue of Middle East Quarterly that goes into this in some detail , in case anyone cares . Yes , we 've seen propaganda before . In the 1930s , some Germans claimed that the Jews were planning to take over the world . Now , what do we see in this book ? What we see in this book is Chris Hedges quoting someone as saying that Israel allows schools to preach that rule should extend from the Nile to the Euphrates . Is there any connection between this and truth ? Yes , there 's a connection . You see , in the Bible ( in Deuteronomy ) , Moses says at one point that Israel 's borders shall run from the river Euphrates to the `` sea '' ( presumably , the Mediterranean , but definitely not the Nile ) . Of course , someone might want to ask a authority about what the Bible says . It turns out that there 's much material in the Book of Numbers , and that is what Pipes says Jews are taught is Biblical . And that specifies a much Israel . In addition , it is quite a leap to go from Biblical borders , no matter how or , to preaching that Jews ought to rule such an area today . Hedges is doing us a disservice here . You may want to check all this for yourselves . In addition , Hedges has an description of the Battle of Khafji ( which took place during Desert Storm ) . Some people who were really there dispute it , however . You may want to check that as well . We also see Hedges describe the behavior of Israeli soldiers in Gaza on June 17 , 2001 . Now , remember that these soldiers are trained to obey orders . Their superiors know that Israel ca n't afford violence . The soldiers are there to protect lives , not to hurt or kill others . And in fact , it turns out to be that in the fighting between Jews and Arabs , the Jews ( as expected ) have rarely been of violence . On the hand , the Arabs , who have rather goals and constraints , have displayed quite a bit of behavior . Nevertheless , in spite of logic and facts to the , in this book , Hedges comes up with the following ( as , I encourage you to verify for yourselves what the truth is , and you might want to start by finding out how people died that day and who they were ) : '' I had seen children shot in conflicts that I had covered - death squads gunned them down in El Salvador and Guatemala , mothers with infants were lined up and massacred in Algeria , and Serb snipers put children in their sights and watched them crumple onto the pavement in Sarajevo - but I had never watched soldiers entice children like mice into a trap and murder them for sport . '' Well ! What is it about Israelis that could lead them to behave in a manner ? Hedges speculates that exposure to all sorts of reading material about the Holocaust has perverted these men . Well , I 'm perfectly prepared to believe that men and women from all nations have been exposed to all sorts of reading material . But I do n't buy Hedges ' conclusion at all . Nor do I buy any of what he says about the behavior of the soldiers . And no , I 'm not in denial . If you believe Hedges , I think you may be in , though ! I 'll stop here . Anyone of saying what I 've quoted from Hedges so far is of saying anything . We readers do not need this .\", 'Book never arrived - very !

First , it spent too time , at for me , on the details of episodes and players . In this sense , I might have appreciated the treatment had I been a scholar researching the field - but I was n't . Hence , I often found the reading dull . Second , I found Powers ' thesis - that Heisenberg purposefully delayed the bomb program - . It appeared to me that Powers often strained his interpretation of the facts to make them conform to his thesis . For example , when reviewing Heisenberg 's `` Farm Hall '' statement in August 1945 that two tons of U235 was required to make an bomb , Powers suggests that because Heisenberg articulated the lesser amount a week later , and because he purportedly suggested at an date that a bomb could be the size of a football , his `` two ton '' statement was a `` error . '' Equally , if not , is the thought that Heisenberg did indeed grossly overestimate what was required , thereby prompting him to tell Speer in 1942 that a bomb was .

Earlier this year I reviewed what will see as the companion volume to this book ( `` Photoshop Blending Modes Cookbook for Digital Photographers '' ) , written by the author . Unfortunately , the publication is less . It seems to have been written on a pretext that it 's to be to duplicate what artists can do . This seems - from my viewpoint - to be greatly undervaluing the power of Photoshop ( and software ) . Practitioners of art should ( really , constructively ) be looking to explore what the principles of and art can mean within a domain . Plus , the book gets off to a definitely start . The and of two sections is titled `` The Tricks of the Trade '' . Well it would be if just some of the `` tricks '' had been explained in and more accurately . Say , how to make a selection in Photoshop from the precursor ( a alpha channel ) . Or say again , how to make corrections to the photograph using a luminance mask .

Indeed , it could even merit an concluding chapter ( but the book does n't have one of those at all ... . ) .

Additionally , I think that it 's that a book as this simply makes no reference at all to what could be printed from the recipes it contains . Some of the finished ( output ) images might look quite as 3 by 5 reproductions in the book - but does the methodology hold up if you 're targeting a 20 by 36 inch output ( say ) on a format printer ?

'' p. 20 have forced me to conclude that Stormer 's thesis was overwhelmingly . Perhaps the most part of the book was his suggestion that the American educative system was hopelessly . The fact that None Dare Call It Treason was distributed in school classes rather undermines his argument . the thing is , because None Dare Call It Treason is so exhaustively researched , it is far too to be amusing , even when read ironically . and amusement is the product of propaganda . in closing , i would take Communism over John A.

I recently picked up a copy of Mage : The Awakening not knowing quite what to expect . Since Ars Magica I 've loved Mage . From GURPs I quickly switched over to White Wolf 's editions of Mage : The Ascension , finally setting on the revised copy most commonly used on game sites today . Mage : The Ascension Revised was truly a delight , featuring a complexity never seen before in role playing games . A complexity that made working truly fun , sure there were flaws , without a Storyteller you could easily abuse the ended magic system to do absolutely anything you wanted ... but it was a price to pay for flexibility , possibilities and an all around RP system . Is it to compare Mage : The Awakening with Mage : The Ascension Revised ? Of course not , the game has to be based on its merits and flaws . The problem is that this game seems to suffer from a lack of creativity which pervades the RP RP market . It also seems to be marketed toward a very audience . With the exception of some really RP books ( White Wolf 's translation of `` Engel '' from the , a role playing experience distinct onto itself and wholly , and `` Demon : The Fallen '' - which was unfortunately a flop and still managed to be ) , RP books are typically very bland and all the . Mage : The Awakening is no . Unfortunately it tries to blend mechanics with spells as though Mage books have been too complicated ( which they have n't , unless the World of Darkness market is much than they previously were ... which is a possibility , or perhaps they are n't in depth so much as they are just having fun ) . There is absolutely nothing culturally about the Mage : The Awakening game system . If you enjoyed the Buddhist , Hindu , the forms of Christian , Judaic and outlooks being in your game system , Mage : The Awakening takes a step back from the pluralism/intellectually material found in its predecessors and offers a quick , fun system with no appeal . The background story of Mage : The Awakening is simply . reviews constantly pick on Atlantis , but for a reason : there 's simply nothing else to pick on ! The Awakening is simply of any depth whatsoever , but what it does do is provide some rotes ( spells ) instead . Another problem is that there are no antagonists . In Mage games there were antagonists you could use or not use depending on your game . In Awakening they do n't even offer any choices . This game is obviously online and in settings ( online , where depth is usually called for , Mage : The Ascension is still used quite frequently ) . Some qualities about the book are that it has an production value and it provides a game system to play with . Provided you had an Storyteller present with lots of storyline ideas , you might have a fun tabletop session . But quite aside from the production value I ca n't recommend this book . The problem of all is that it simply has nothing about it ... nothing to make it stand out and be playing over game systems . In an age of simplicity please do yourself a favor and have a patience and find yourself a Storyteller . Go back and read the books that made this one sell like hotcakes - buy the `` '' Mage books - if you still want to , pick up a copy of The Awakening and somehow incorporate it in your game\", \"Awakening is Inferior to Ascension White Wolf wanted to revitalize a product line by rewriting it and they had problems with the system that deserved fixing . They did an job on the core rules and the game mechanics are the they 've ever been . One of the flaws of MAGE : Ascension was that it is dominated by the struggle between the Technocracy and the Traditions , in a manner that reflected Vampire : Masquerade 's clan structure and Sabbat vs Camarilla . One of the flaws of Vampire : Masquerade was that it had this history of `` Caine as the vampire and the Anti-Diluvians as the founders of the clans '' , that overshadowed the game . In Mage : Ascension , Mages saw themselves as having evolved over time and that history had been by the technocracy , so who really knew about the past ? In Awakening they took exactly what they were trying to jettison from Vampire and put it into Mage with the creation of Atlantis and the Exarchs . The Societies that replace the traditions are not as interesting . The replacement of Avatars with Towers does n't make sense to me . The struggle theme remains with the Exarchs but seems a lot less than the struggle over the consensus in Ascension . Awakening is or rotes . For , Mage in a LARP , rotes are , shifting emphasis to rotes improves the compatibility of and action systems , but detracts from the experience where Mages can do almost anything . They split the Entropy Sphere into Death and Fate , which kind of makes sense , except that Death has too overlap with Spirit . I 'm going to use the Mechanics with the world in my campaign . The Mage setting does n't inspire me like the one did . While the Vampire and Werewolf settings may catch on , I think the Mage is going to be a flop -- after the core book I do n't expect to purchase any of the supplements .\", \"Get of the glasses I bought this book but should have listened to my gut feeling ... look at the picture of the `` Forever Cool '' Ms Mathieson on the cover .

Wolf is not nearly as , and logically organized as Weste and Harris - no comparison', 'Ironic -- an book on productivity The book is divided into 52 chapters that repeat basically the points over and over again . So you have to read through the chapters and try to spot the idea . It seems that a book on productivity makes you time gleaning a ideas . ( Come on , man , if you have 10 pages of ideas , give them to me in 10 . ) But then again I guess most books in this genre make you do that . Sheesh', \"An opinion on Hendrix - far from anything If your into Hendrix enough to want to find out about Electric Ladyland , your probably already going to know everything in this book . If you 've read Hendrix books as Gypsy ' then you wo n't get much from this book than information obtained that you 've read before from Gypsy ' coloured in this authors opinion on Jimi 's music . The author lays down his opinion that reads like someone either not overly impressed by Jimi Hendrix , or someone that has trouble laying praise where it 's . The author makes calls in this book which fall flat , for example expressing his view on how Jimi could of edited and recorded songs better in his opinion ( not unlike like Alan Douglas made ) or trips like footnotes after mentioning 'Like A Rolling Stone ' at Monterey can only be outdone by the to find Flamingo Club version in 1968 - where does he get that from ? The Flamingo club version is near for of the recording with its vocals and the very distorted at the very and is no way a rendition than Monterey but the book has comments by the author like that which only makes you think , is this guy trying to brag about his Hendrix collection ? Or does he just have to have a opinion on everything to try and make his book , which really has nothing , stand out from the pack ? His opinions would be if he did n't try to go against the grain to just go against the grain ! If you 've ever heard or seen Jimi at Monterey you do n't need to be told how so people thought he played crap that night - the evidence that this is one of his performances is there on CD or on the screen as you watch it which just makes bringing up that side without balancing it with the rave reviews he also got seem targeted . Why point out the things and not mention the ? If you want to learn the side of the recording or the side of Hendrix , you wo n't learn it from this book . You 'll get the Hendrix bio for of it with this Authors comments , some reviews for Electric Ladyland to show Hendrix was after all guess and an author bringing up all his 'friends ' and 'visits ' to people that are well documented in knowing Jimi . All in all , if you have no opinion on Hendrix and read this you probably wo n't think he 's that and get a opinion on him , if you love Hendrix and read this you 'll wonder why this Author bothered to write a book about Jimi in the place than to let us know he has so friends that knew Jimi , was enough to see him play a times and the of all , could of done some things better in his opinion . Two stars because there 's books out there with much information about Electric Ladyland , let alone Hendrix , that are n't trying to Jimi 's history from one person 's perspective and critique thou it 's and quite if you have a Hendrix library anyway .\", 'overrated This is by far one of the parenting books I have read .

The metaphors they speak , think , and by which they -- and their adventures -- are continually described , bore to tears . Aside from an scrape between Coy and the dwarf or his boss , all of the action in NC clusters at the beginning ( promisingly so , I 'll grant ) and the end ( all wimper , no bang ) of this novel .

Nonetheless , the story falls and I found it just barely compelling enough to finish ; the plot moves slowly , punctuated by one clumsily executed plot twist after another , the descriptions of action are confusing , and the characters outlines devoid of development .

Normally , I would have donated the book ater reading it . But , in this case I was so , I threw the book away after reading it .

I was also disapponted in the Oprah book club selection committee . It seemed to me they found a `` story '' they liked , and that is where their thinking ended . It was the and Oprah book selection I ever bought . After reading it , it was to me that whoever had chosen the book for the Oprah club had never been to Pa . I am from PA as is O'Dell and this book lacks color . She either forgot or choose to ignore that language is also a part of the landscape of a locale .

It is not even really about heartland , the part of the book is based in Occanumba . Also , there are hardly any horses in this book , just Maverick ( who is only a part ) and a bit of Spindleberry and Albatross . It is mainly about Carey and her mood swings . It is also a bit , as Amy comes out eith long , involved , speeches that no teenager i know would blab on about ! The way she talks is more like a psychatrist ! I also think that the most books have been targeted at a audience . At the start of the series i would class them as 'young adult ' material , but now they are just for kids who like horses . She is supposed to be going out with Ty but they never seem to kiss much or do anything . In this book he goes to Occanumba with Amy and they do n't even get off together once ! Even though they are in the all alone at one point , with no adults around . All in all this book is , but rather . Nothing happens , thought Amy might at have an arguement with Joni when she takes over with Spindleberry , but no , Amy has gone and does n't do anything .

I was excited to see she had written another romance and not a mystery with a sex scene thrown in . But , when I got to the line of this book I found myself closing it and thinking that I had once again been suckered by memories of Claire McNab . This book has a lot of promise to it -- therefore the two stars I gave it -- but it 's promise . There is a setup of the writer Vonny Smith pining for the attention of her editor , Diana . But , why exactly is she in love with Diana ? Darn if I know . The writing has humor and spoofs the genre of romance novels . But the novel is a setup and , in the end , there is no delivery . It 's annoying , frustrating , and feels like a cheat . Was n't there an editor to say : `` Claire , this story needs ! '' Or was Bella Books just intent on cashing in on Ms. McNab 's name ?

I 've found a number of inconsistencies with history that should be to anyone who has read this thing closely . For example , on page 7 Coleman says `` the Club of Rome was established in 1968 '' , but on page 17 he suggests that the Club of Rome played `` a role in the Cuban Missile Crisis '' and `` attempted to sell its 'crisis management ' ... progam to President Kennedy . '' Unless we 've been misled , the Cuban Missile Crisis happened a 6 years before this group was founded . What are readers to make of a passage ? Either it 's a typo and he means 1958 , or , as I heartily , he does n't have a grasp on his subject . On page 9 Coleman suggests Henry `` Kissinger 's role in destabilizing the United States by three wars , the Middle East , Korea , and Vietnam is well known ... '' However , Kissinger , working at Harvard from 1948 , had no role in the U.S. government until the 1960 's , working for the Kennedy Administration . The Korean War , as we are all , occured in 1950 , and ended long before Kissinger had any influence on policy . If it were that Kissinger had an influence on the United States ' policy in Korea , for example , then Coleman would be to address that issue at this point in his text . However , he only leaves us with the `` is well known '' . It is definitely NOT well known , and Coleman is just fooling those readers who think that a book which is to read or which is discussing subjects must be . These are just a of the inconsistencies that I could check in a time that Coleman throws out at you . If you 're not a reader , you 'll be tricked into accepting some really ideas . If you prefer speculation to reason , then by all means gorge yourself in the nectar of `` what ifs '' . If you 're looking for something based on reality , then , rider , pass by\", \"A backlash wolf in sheeps clothing It would take a book to answer all that is with Farrell 's reasoning , but to make a points : 1 . He implies that 'circumcision ' is much the as male circumcision which is astounding but points to his ignorance . If circumcision is about teaching males to endure pain ( actually more about male bonding ) then what on earth is a girl being taught when she has her genitalia cut away and is left with a hole and a life-time of pain and health problems ? ? It 's for protection ? What , or whose , interests are being protected ? 2 . He does not acknowledge that the life-span is to testosterone and all its consequences for males . Castration is known to increase the life-span . Why do men even want testosterone rather than ? Surely ? 3 . The 'instinct ' to protect females is actually to protect the bodies men need for sex and reproduction . As than 50 million females have been killed recently in Asia simply because they were should make us question this supposed 'instinct to protect ' . And protecting females most often translates into ownership and control . This is a logic to that of men in cultures that use the pretext of honor to justify the murder of females . Why do women need protection form their protectors ? Men need to explain their logic here . Is it something like the protection gangs provide for people against gangs ? 4 . Powerless men are created by competition for access to females and again , the testosterone drives this not women . 5 . His views on rape are . Young females have signals whether they want sex or not . These signals do not usually reflect the females desires and concerns and this causes the confusion . Men are responding to fake signals that females do n't know how to override without becoming altogether . 6 . This book is basically about all the hoops males try and jump through in order to rise in the male hierarchy and ultimately get their DNA into numbers of men who fail are the men without power . Farrell wants us to feel sorry for them which is as as men feeling sorry for , and diverting their interest and resources towards , women . 7.Farrell does not explain the irrationality of men rejecting and being about women who do n't sexually reject men ( ie the women ) at the time as they complain about the pain of being sexually rejected so often by women . There must be some logic to it - perhaps situated in a world of being the male who is n't rejected . Duplicity is clearly a trait that farrell failed to mention . 8 . It is a logic that concludes that the people who have been the lawmakers and leaders for millennia ie males , have actually only been acting in the self-interest of females . For men to have evolved a lack of self-interest is . To argue that they have is Farrell 's argument . Of course women also have , intimately tied to that of their children . The very difference is that because we evolved with a mating system where females moved to kin groups to breed males had the advantages of size , kin-bonding , no demands of offspring and time and cicumstances that enabled them to be the rule-makers which included the enforcement of ownership and control of females as they were exchanged between groups for breeding . They may have felt varying amounts of power within that system and they may have felt the power of their sex needs as power but to say that this is actually women having and exercising power is absurdly and to reality . It is another fantasy to add to that of South Sea Island sex and mermaids . This book is interesting for debate and as an example of frustration being blamed on women . Ultimately it is about how some men suffer trying to get access to females and might help us notice that the ' being defined is reproduction . In a market where the supply of sperm far outstrips the market of eggs it does reduce the value of sperm and create competition in males and competition in females for quality sperm and/or extras that improve the outcome for offspring . Embedded in Farrell 's books is the attempt to solve this by encouraging women to 'put out ' . It 's the male longing for 'free ' sex ie the behavior of male animals where post-copulatory costs are carried by females . In animals experience far or disposability as females when they are and concentrate on parenting ie are with behavior . Can we look forward to this in the male in the future and solve the whole problem ? Can we expect men might consider reducing the supply ie their partners and increasing their childcare . Reduce testosterone ? Or is that blasphemy ? The question is What do men want ? The answer is the as ever - sex . The methods of trying to get it are the even when put in a wrapper as Farrell 's irrationality , deceit and manipulation . Perhaps the myth is the myth of ADULT power and we should direct our anger and frustration towards our gametes , hormones , fetuses , infants and children that are the reason males and females exist , are pulled together and apart . At let 's not create a myth that the male somehow managed to evolve a lack of self-interest . How does Farrell hope we are\", \"Over Rated !

First off , I have not read this book myself , so disreguard this review if you want . I 'm reviewing it because based on the reviews and what I can tell here , and from descriptions from my mother , I believe this is the book she used in a attempt to potty-train me . I am 99 % , but she does not remember the title so I ca n't be 100 % sure . My mother described a system where she devoted one day to nothing but potty-training . She got everyone else out of the house , and removed all my toys from eyesight . Then she went through a explanation using a doll and had me try to explain it back , using the doll . She then showed me what looked like a kitchen of toys and candy , and told me I would get rewarded for using the potty that day . I remember all that part . After that she said that we went through a process where she had to scold me for accidents and we did nothing but try to go all day . I was definately enough to be doing this , because I actually remember it . ( I am 25 now , so if this book was published in the 70s or early 80s , I 'm being accurate . ) Now , let me tell you the results . I do n't remember how I felt that day , but I do know that it started something that became a battle for me . I was a very child , and I am a very adult . What mom and I remember was that became a war in our home- and it took YEARS . Because of my sensitivities and my mother 's choice in training methods , I began holding my bowel movements . ( I was urinate in the potty at a age , not when . ) I would hold bowel movements whenever I had the urge to go , even if she put me back in a diaper . I held for weeks at times , and sometimes this required a lot of pain for me ( obviously ) . When it finally got to the point that I could n't hold it anymore , the BM was so that I needed help to go . Sometimes it would get so that the result would happen- I 'd have a diarheaa because the muscles were fatigued . This went on for years , and the doctors kept telling mom that I 'd eventually outgrow it . She tried suppositories , oil , fiber , and even started giving me doses of laxatives . Finally , when I was 5 ( two years into this ) , Mom made a tape recording of me SCREAMING while trying to go to the bathroom . A doctor took pity on us and prescribed enemas . I used them on and off for two years . I was finally fully trained- AT SEVEN . I am now 25 , and occasionally I still notice some health problems that may be to this . Now , obviously there is no way I can fully explain why all that happened , and I certainly can not blame all of that on the book . I was a very kid , and my mom picked a time to do it too ( I had just had a baby brother ) . But I just want to describe the danger of using a method . And I 'm not just talking about the pain I went through if we 're to believe theories about the stage of well , let 's just say I could be his poster child . I am now my highly daughter , who will be 3 in a week . We have been working on this ( no specific methods , just lots of sitting on the potty ) for over a year now , and with NO results . But I 'm not in a hurry , and thats because she 's not , and we need to do this on her timetable , not mine\", \"TOO SEXUALLY EXPLICIT FOR MY TASTE As I was reading this book , I came across poems that were far too sexually for my taste , to name a : `` The First , '' `` Images of Heaven '' and `` Full Summer .

I picked up David Sacks ' book from Borders ' Linguistics stack because of the title . I should have known better . I started the chapter and did n't have the time or intention to finish it . The book is a collection of charts and stories about the history of writing that are to be expected from the title -- in some cases conviniently summarized things in tables and maps -- but lacks , in my opinion , thinking on the reasons behind the origin and prosperity of writing that is found in works ( it is not ) . Even within the 20 pages or so , I was disawayed than a times by claims , misinformation , and distastefully Euro/English-centric . Here are some examples : '' The alphabet was not the writing : Egypt , Mesopotamia , and probably China already had systems . But the alphabet was the most writing system ever found , before or since ( p.1 ) '' -- What about Hirogana for Japanese ? Syllabaries can be much more for languages that do not have a inventory of syllables . `` The 'spreadability ' of an alphabet means that the future of our Roman letters looks very indeed . ( 10 ) '' -- He was speaking of languages that are written in alphabets , as Swahili , , Urdu/Hindi , and Yiddish . And then came this comment on the prospect `` our letters '' . Immediately following the quote , he gave examples of and Tatarstan 's decision to switch to Roman , as well as `` struggling nation '' 's likewise decisions to `` switch to Roman letters for tongues , as a to tie into trade and communications and to prepare their prople to learn English . Tragically , that is and spiritually sustaining while be lost . Yet that seems in the century were are shaping . And it is sobering to reflect that our 26 letters wield power . '' His view of the learnability of the alphabet is also , shall I say . The comment could have come from an gradama who happened have NOT been a teacher for her lifetime . `` An alphabet enjoys on advantage over any writing system : It needs symbols . No sysmtem can get away with so . This makes an alphabet to learn . Students need memorize only two dozen or so letters to begin building toward literacy , which typically takes about another five years of instruction '' . And -- he writes -- because of this simplicity , children can become before the age . `` This fact has made the alphabet historically the vehicle of mass literacy . ( p.5 ) '' Well , `` vehicle '' is a very way of framing it . At he is not saying that where there is alphabet there is literacy . Mass literacy was nevery a goal before the inducstry revolution . Now Sacks joins the ranks of you-know-who 's by implying that the Europeans and ideals were destined to take over the world because they had the alphabet and probably the mandate from God . ( Guns , what guns ? ) Sacks also compared `` our 26 letters '' -- as if writing is patented at the USPO -- to Chinese . `` schoolchildren normally take three years longer than children to learn to read and write , with of that time devoted to mastering the symbols . '' This is completely misinformation . Learning to read Chinese is not , but do a research , you will find studies over studies and books over books on studies of literacy ( including my ) . I 've nevery seen a study that substantiates the lag . By the way , Sacks almost never gives citations . I think that 's . This explains my disappointment with the book -- I shold n't have any expectation from the start , had I known who David Sacks is .\", \"I kept waiting for her to leave him The hero is a , brute who does not deserve his wife Kassia.He should have been made to marry Joanna the woman he was betrothed to.I could n't get Graelam raping Kassia , I really couldn't.I know this is England and women were more or less treated like chattel , but on.Kassia is a girl who does everything to please this philandering , brute of a sleeps with one of the servants after he marries Kassia , when she confronts him he threatens to beat and rape her which he had already done ( I shuddered again right there ) .There 's not one but two women undermining Kassia 's authority and she sits back and takes this , please !

When I was a teenager , I 'd go on candy binges that required insulin doses bordering on the , and I got through school with only the zit . I 've read that for a number of people , can be a factor for acne , but obviously our experience points to something else as the cause ( this assumes you eat reasonably well - malnutrition is n't ) .

This book came highly recommended from reviews here , so I read it . My reaction to the book ? It took a while , but I finally realized it felt like I was reading a study paid for and prepared on behalf of the video game industry . There are lots of statistics , but rather defending video game playing and how it 's successfully preparing gamers to succeed in the future . I did learn a things . I got a dose of reality about why it seems like everyone under 35 plays games extensively . I see that the *gamer generation* has a lot to offer . I also seriously wonder about the gaps in what they have to offer . A thesis of the book is that gamers learn how to think and figure things out , because games are about figuring out how to beat the game . Interesting , since by the examples cited , it mostly appears to be trial and error with no logic involved . I call it by trying anything , as opposed to learn by thinking . Both have their place . Supposedly , gamers are more to take ( theoretically controlled ) risks as well . Somehow the authors see the dot.com boom ( and bust ) as an endorsement of the future of business in the hands of gamers ( who largely ran the dot.coms ) . I see a story than the authors from those days of yore . I could go on , but I think you get the point . The book says ( nothing ? ) about how games are helping gamers learn math , science , or reading . Personally , I believe those skills/knowledge are MUCH more to a person 's future than the ability to learn trial and error . Maybe the conclusions of the authors will prove to be . I hope so .

Consider as one example the book 's `` Do Not Use '' warning regarding the prescription drug , Armour Thyroid . Rather than offering any research to support this recommendation ( because there IS N'T any research ) , the `` guide '' instead quotes the AMA and the American Thyroid Association , two groups that greatly enjoy the largesse of the drug makers who want to put Armour -- a far less drug -- out of business . If this is the sort of `` information '' you want about the drugs you take , you might as well go ahead and just read the company pamphlets .

I must say I was n't inspired at all not even on one item and I am usually quite easily inspired by just reading a mag , browsing through ebay or simply walking around the market . The pics are but on flowers ? ? I think I should 've got the book instead\", \"DIY Cover Up I too eagerly reading this book , since I went through an blitz this summer . I was a bit , however . Although the photos and instructions are ( for seamsters more than myself ) , the tone of the book is , with statements about working mothers and a lot of nostalgia for the Ozzie and Harriet era . Although Geisel celebrates the rebirth of the arts , she praises the home-as-nest ( enclave of domesticity ) rather than the house-as-studio ( a DIY workshop involving every member in acts of engagement with economy , history , and culture . ) Still , there 's some history and some photos\", \"I make movies and travel extensively . My life is . This is not very . That is to say , the writing and the fluidity of Gazzara 's life become bland and quite fast . I initially picked it up because as an actor I find biographies or autobio 's about somewhat people more than approaching someone like Paul Newman or Brando , who each have books ... And Gazzara 's career has been an intruiging one . As a member of the Actors Studio , which produced the actors along with others , his rise to Broadway and Hollywood was . He originated Brick in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , and played his film for Otto Preminger-opposite James Stewart and George C. Scott , among Anatomy of a Murder . But his approach to acting , which is of importance to me , was not chronicled . Instead he regales with stories of what and who the people he worked with were . What the country he was shooting in was like , etc. , etc . One of his sources of regard is his work with John Cassavetes , and it is Cassavetes was a influence and friend , someone Gazzara owes much , and the process by which they created Husbands and films is investigated than any . Cassavetes too comes out as a more , Than Life guy , while Gazzara 's tales of living in Italy , or being in Spain , New York , Hollywood , the Philippines , etc. , etc . just made me ... I guess I wanted to know about the life of an Actor who has worked as long as Gazzara has , is still relatively never became a `` star , '' and continues to work , without feeling he is a hack who does n't take his work seriously..\", 'There are choices . I found this book sadly lacking in substance and quality activities . Spend your money on Days of Knights and Damsels by Carlson', \"dictionary of doublespeak Not recommended for speakers of the language . When trees == forests and directories are instead 'naming contexts ' ... . The format would be `` This feature , which MS call ' X ' , is ' Y ' plain '' , but instead the Y feature will only ever be called X . This is not a book\", \"a place to visit ... . If I had been an editor and received `` Slipper '' , I would have said the following : '' Dear Ms. Wan , Your book is for the reasons : 1 ) The Setting . One hazard of writing about the place where you spend your summers is that you end up writing through the eyes of a visitor rather than a . Dordogne sounds , and I 'd certainly like to visit it based on your descriptions of pigeon coops and sheep scattered across the landscape , but it is disturbing that you have cicadas singing in May . It suggests you are only with the setting during the vacation months when you habitually visit . To really describe a place , I think you need to know it . 2 ) The characters . Because you spend your summers in Dordogne , you appear to know only foreigners . All your characters are expatriates with irritatingly occupations . I do n't know if you realize that all the characters you portray are ugly , , sexually depraved , mentally , , or terminally , and they all appear to make cheese . Surely this is n't a portrayal of the . 3 ) The Orchids . Actually , the orchids are , but the idea that orchid fanciers are and possibly homicidal is a one ; fanciers are fairly . Also , the idea that a slipper mutant would spontaneously occur and allow the orchid to live outside its habitat is . Anyone would tell you that a hybrid is a bet . 4 ) The Dogs . One cute dog is ; two are too . Puppies are . 5 ) The Romance . writer are of the hazard of including a romance in a mystery , but you walked in innocently , that your two characters are , and have no chemistry ( and that 's not even mentioning their dogs ) . You set a obstacle in their path by having one think the is a killer ; a writer might be to pull this off , but you ca n't . 6 ) Trendoid aspects . novels are century . But having a NY psychiatrist profile the killer by email is so WEEK . You will be you did this , sooner rather than later . 7 ) The Ending . Ridiculous and . Georges Simenon wrote about crime with acuity . You should read one of his books .\", \"boring This book is very . The writing is and rather . The writer bored me , maybe something 's lost in translation from , I do n't know . I already knew the killer the time he was introduced in the book , although the writer tried to create herrings which did not work . Mara sounds , immature and inconsistent . Skip this book , it 's not your time . Peter Mayle 's mysteries set in France are way that this . At his novels have sense of humor , suspense , very characters and most , they are very well written\", \"Lacking I was extremely by this book/pamphlet , being misled by the reviews . It is completely lacking in information . It has 51 6 '' x8 '' pages with font and too cartoons . It successfully defines what is and posture , but does not provide excercises to improve it ( it simply states to `` practice '' posture ) . There are much alternatives . I have read `` Alignment '' and recommend that , and have heard of reviews for `` Posture , Get It Straight ! ''\", \"Okay for ideas This book is the package of business ideas . The book gets 2 stars because the pages devoted to entrepreneurship has very substance and the information under each idea is and in cases not . In addition , there are ideas that require a amount of work . The author does state that what may be work for one person , may be play to another . However , this relates to doing something you enjoy or having a passion where you do n't mind putting in the time or work . The title suggests that the business ideas listed in the book will not require a deal of time or effort , which is not the case for of the ideas ( Masonry , Restauranteur for example ) . This book has some value for those that have not read books of this type . Otherwise , I would take a pass on this one\", \"It 's just `` Reefer Madness '' And you should n't inhale . reviewers have ecstatically proclaimed this book and movie to be an , work , but those who are enough to think they learn history through books and films like `` Hunting '' need to go back and see `` documentaries '' like `` Triumph Of The Will '' , `` The Eternal Jew '' or `` Reefer Madness '' . Let 's be honest , people . This book was written by a strongly columnist and the movie was produced by FOB ( Friend Of Bill ) Harry Thompson . It 's about as as the factually challenged `` Fahrenheit 9/11 '' , a work that Moore himself now calls `` satire '' . ( By the way , I 'll bet you did n't know that Middle Easterners who have seen Moore 's movie are outraged at the shallow , and image he presented of their people and culture . ) The point is , whether or just these books typically contain misrepresentations . If you 're already a member of the author 's congregation , you wo n't care . You 'll shout `` hallelujah ! '' and say that `` Hunting '' has given the world Great Truths . But thinkers understand that it 's to uncritically accept the representations in either this book or the movie .\"]\n"
